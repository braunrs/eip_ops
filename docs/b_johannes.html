<p>This metrics report shows data for encounter information for <strong>Brooke Johannes</strong>. Any data contained within this report covers clinical information captured in the EIP Database since <strong>January 1st, 2023</strong>. The metrics in this report describe specific encounter information and the services and/or referrals that were provided to patients/clients.</p>
<p>Until a unique patient identifier is created for patients seen by EIP, matching unique patients across multiple years of encounters is difficult. Therefore, patient demographic and population information will refer only to the number of encounters, not the unique number of patients. This part of the report is still in development.</p>

<h1>Encounter Information</h1>
<p>The remainder of this metrics report is all encounter-based information. Since some of our staff have responsibilities that may have them performing tasks that cross multiple roles within the program, all metrics are considered here when discussing encounter information. For example, linkage information is evaluated below even though not all staff perform linkage duties. This will keep the metric reports for all staff consistent, and allow for the transition into other roles at any time without an interruption in this reporting structure. Encounters are defined and stratified by EIP team member by the following information captured in the EIP Database:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Encounters:</strong> <em>An encounter is any visit that is created within the patient record in the EIP Database, whether service information is provided or not. Every encounter should have some type of service entered (i.e.&nbsp;Assessment, HIV/HCV Testing, Linkage), but is still counted as an encounter if something is entered within the record (i.e.&nbsp;just Encounter Information or Encounter Checklist info).</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Staff indication:</strong> <em>There are background variables on each page in the EIP Database that captures the REDCap username of the individual completing the form. If you created any of the forms for that encounter within the EIP Database, or if your name is selected as the “EIP Counselor” on the Encounter Checklist page, then you are attached to that record in some capacity and noted in these numbers. If you work as a peer and your name is selected on the “Peer Support” form, that also indicates that encounter as one you were involved with in some way, and thus counted here.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Brooke has had a total of <strong>44 encounters</strong> entered into the EIP Database since January 1st, 2023. A summary table of these encounters and what they consisted of are shown below.</p>

<p>The graph below shows the total number of encounters Brooke has had during each month within the reporting period. Also, the total number of each service provided are shown by the trend lines, which allows you to see trends over time. The definitions for how each of these numbers are stratified is described below the graph. This plot is dynamic, meaning you can select and deselect each particular metric by clicking the text in the legend on the right to focus on particular services provided. The plot also has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by dragging the pointer to select the desired timeframe, and you can also scroll through timepoints using the slider below the x-axis. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot. As mentioned above, not all staff offer or perform these services, so you can deselect the ones not within Brooke’s role for a more tailored focus of tasks. This is a visual representation of the data shown in the complete summary metrics table above.</p>

<p>Assessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (<strong>SUD</strong>), mental health (<strong>MH</strong>), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (<strong>PrEP</strong>), all examined below. Brooke has conducted a total of <strong>24 assessments</strong>, which means that 54.5% of Brooke’s encounters consisted of an assessment (<em>24/44</em>).</p>
<p>A summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.</p>

<p>SUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered <strong>screened for SUD</strong>. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are <strong>considered positive for a SUD</strong>. The total number of assessments completed by Brooke during this reporting period is <strong>24</strong>, with <strong>24 assessments</strong> having been screened for a SUD (<em>100.0%, 24/24</em>). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of <strong>2</strong> that were positive for SUD (<em>8.3%, 2/24</em>).</p>

<p>MH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered <strong>screened for MH</strong>. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are <strong>considered positive for a MH condition</strong>. However, <span style="color: red;">it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed</span>. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was <strong>13</strong> (<em>54.2%, 13/24</em>). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD <em>and</em> completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was <strong>0</strong> (<em>0.0%, 0/2</em>). <em>Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 2), not all assessments (n = 24), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.</em></p>
<p>For all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of <strong>0</strong> that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (<em>NA, 0/0</em>). In regards to the specific conditions that were assessed, those are provided below the table.</p>

<p>PrEP eligibility is covered by several different questions scattered within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Brooke conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was <strong>1 assessments</strong> (<em>4.2% of all those assessed, 1/24</em>). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was <strong>1 assessments</strong> (<em>100.0% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 1/1</em>). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks <em>and</em> received this PrEP assessment was <strong>1 assessments</strong> (<em>100.0% of all those eligible for PrEP, 1/1</em>).</p>

<p>Additionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Brooke has had a total of <strong>0 tests that have resulted in a false positive</strong> (<em>0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/7</em>), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.</p>
<p>There are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (<em>HIV RNA testing</em>). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Brooke currently has a total of <strong>0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing</strong> (<em>0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/7</em>). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status.</p>

<p>Referrals are documented in the EIP database in three different ways at the encounter level: (1) provided information, such as brochures/pamphlets or referral lists with community programs, (2) provided internal referral for that service to one of EIP’s linkage coordinators, or (3) an external referral to a specific agency. Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.</p>
<p>There are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list. Those referral types are indicated within the table to the left as well as the figure below, and listed here: <em>primary care (PCP), ED social work (SW), and Peer services</em>.</p>
<p>The table to the left highlights the total number of referrals provided during the initial encounter as well as the total number of referrals provided during the linkage follow-up. These referrals do not necessarily mean that Brooke is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. <em>For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral</em>.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. <em>For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter</em>.</p>

<section id="linkage-to-care" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="linkage-to-care">Linkage to Care</h2>
<p>Linkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (<em>but not limited to</em>) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Brooke does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Brooke, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.</p>
<p>The total number of LTC cases that Brooke has been involved with is <strong>0 LTC cases</strong>. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Brooke’s cases that were “eligible” were <strong>0 eligible LTC cases</strong> (<em>0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0</em>). Brooke currently has an open case load of <strong>0 open cases</strong> (<em>0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0</em>), with <strong>0 open LTC cases</strong> being open longer than 90 days (<em>0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0</em>). Therefore, Brooke has successfully <strong>closed 0 LTC cases</strong> (<em>0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0</em>), with a total of <strong>0 cases successfully linked to care</strong> for their particular service (<em>0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0</em>). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.</p>
