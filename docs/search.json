Any data contained within this report covers clinical information captured in the EIP Database since January 1st, 2023. The metrics in this report describe specific encounter information and the services and/or referrals that were provided to patients/clients.\nUntil a unique patient identifier is created for patients seen by EIP, matching unique patients across multiple years of encounters is difficult. Therefore, patient demographic and population information will refer only to the number of encounters, not the unique number of patients. This part of the report is still in development."

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Archit has conducted a total of 215 assessments, which means that 46.1% of Archit’s encounters consisted of an assessment (215/551).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Archit during this reporting period is 215, with 203 assessments having been screened for a SUD (94.4%, 203/215). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 64 that were positive for SUD (31.5%, 64/203).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    05/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    24 \n    22 \n    91.7% \n    9 \n    40.9% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    10 \n    9 \n    90.0% \n    2 \n    22.2% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    13 \n    12 \n    92.3% \n    2 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    14 \n    14 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    21.4% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    15 \n    15 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    26.7% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    10 \n    9 \n    90.0% \n    5 \n    55.6% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    26 \n    25 \n    96.2% \n    6 \n    24.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    17 \n    16 \n    94.1% \n    7 \n    43.8% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    11 \n    10 \n    90.9% \n    3 \n    30.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    12 \n    11 \n    91.7% \n    8 \n    72.7% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    25 \n    23 \n    92.0% \n    9 \n    39.1% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    34 \n    33 \n    97.1% \n    4 \n    12.1% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    215 \n    203 \n    94.4% \n    64 \n    31.5% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 62 (28.8%, 62/215). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 63 (29.3%, 63/64). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 64), not all assessments (n = 215), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 3 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (4.8%, 3/63). In regards to the specific conditions that were assessed, those are provided below the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    Brief MH Assessed \n    % Brief MH Assessed \n    SUD + \n    MH Assessed \n    % MH Assessed \n    MH + \n    % MH + \n  \n \n\n  \n    05/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    4 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    24 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    9 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    10 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    13 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    14 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    3 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    15 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    4 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    10 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    5 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    26 \n    5 \n    19.2% \n    6 \n    5 \n    83.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    17 \n    9 \n    52.9% \n    7 \n    9 \n    128.6% \n    1 \n    11.1% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    11 \n    5 \n    45.5% \n    3 \n    5 \n    166.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    12 \n    4 \n    33.3% \n    8 \n    4 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    25 \n    15 \n    60.0% \n    9 \n    15 \n    166.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    34 \n    24 \n    70.6% \n    4 \n    25 \n    625.0% \n    2 \n    8.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    215 \n    62 \n    28.8% \n    64 \n    63 \n    29.3% \n    3 \n    4.8% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepression: total of 61 assessed (96.8% of all those assessed for MH, 61/63), with 0 positive (0.0% of all those screened for depression, 0/61).\nAnxiety: total of 44 assessed (69.8% of all those assessed for MH, 44/63), with 0 positive (0.0% of all those screened for anxiety, 0/44).\nPTSD: total of 10 assessed (15.9% of all those assessed for MH, 10/63), with 3 positive (30.0% of all those screened for PTSD, 3/10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    MH Assessed \n    Depression Assessed \n    % Depression Assessed \n    Depression positive \n    % Depression positive \n    Anxiety Assessed \n    % Anxiety Assessed \n    Anxiety positive \n    % Anxiety positive \n    PTSD Assessed \n    % PTSD Assessed \n    PTSD positive \n    % PTSD positive \n  \n \n\n  \n    05/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    4 \n    80.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    9 \n    8 \n    88.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    8 \n    88.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    6 \n    66.7% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    4 \n    80.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    15 \n    15 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    5 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    25 \n    24 \n    96.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    23 \n    92.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    8.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    63 \n    61 \n    96.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    44 \n    69.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    10 \n    15.9% \n    3 \n    30.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\nPrEP eligibility is covered by several different questions scattered within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Archit conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 177 assessments (82.3% of all those assessed, 177/215). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 45 assessments (25.4% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 45/177). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 12 assessments (26.7% of all those eligible for PrEP, 12/45).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    05/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    4 \n    3 \n    75.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    24 \n    21 \n    87.5% \n    6 \n    28.6% \n    4 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    10 \n    7 \n    70.0% \n    1 \n    14.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    13 \n    10 \n    76.9% \n    4 \n    40.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    14 \n    14 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    35.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    15 \n    14 \n    93.3% \n    7 \n    50.0% \n    1 \n    14.3% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    10 \n    8 \n    80.0% \n    1 \n    12.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    26 \n    22 \n    84.6% \n    8 \n    36.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    17 \n    14 \n    82.4% \n    1 \n    7.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    11 \n    8 \n    72.7% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    12 \n    8 \n    66.7% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    25 \n    19 \n    76.0% \n    6 \n    31.6% \n    3 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    34 \n    29 \n    85.3% \n    1 \n    3.4% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    215 \n    177 \n    82.3% \n    45 \n    25.4% \n    12 \n    26.7% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Archit, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Archit has conducted (n = 141), there have been 2 positive tests (1.42% of all HIV tests, 2/141). There have been a total of 2 positive CTR tests (1.42% of all CTR tests, 2/141) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.0% of all EHE tests, 0/0).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Archit has identified a total of 2 new positive individuals (100.0% of all positive HIV tests, 2/2). This number is comprised of 2 new positives from CTR testing (100.00% percent of all CTR positive tests, 2/2) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Archit’s HIV testing is 1.42% (2/141), and for each program specifically is as follows: 1.42% for CTR (2/141) and 0.0% for EHE (0/0).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    141 \n    141 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    2 \n    2 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    2 \n    2 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    1.42% \n    1.42% \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Archit has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/141), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Archit currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/141). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Archit is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process.

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Archit does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Archit, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Archit has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Archit’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Archit currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Archit has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below.

The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Alaa has conducted a total of 144 assessments, which means that 35.4% of Alaa’s encounters consisted of an assessment (144/503).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Alaa during this reporting period is 144, with 143 assessments having been screened for a SUD (99.3%, 143/144). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 78 that were positive for SUD (54.5%, 78/143).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    04/2023 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    6 \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    83.3% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    12 \n    70.6% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    15 \n    15 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    40.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    19 \n    19 \n    100.0% \n    12 \n    63.2% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    8 \n    72.7% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    87.5% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    6 \n    5 \n    83.3% \n    3 \n    60.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    75.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    15 \n    15 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    46.7% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    13 \n    13 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    46.2% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    12.5% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    144 \n    143 \n    99.3% \n    78 \n    54.5% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 127 (88.2%, 127/144). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 127 (88.2%, 127/78). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 78), not all assessments (n = 144), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 34 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (26.8%, 34/127).

eligibility is covered by several different questions scattered within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Alaa conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 128 assessments (88.9% of all those assessed, 128/144). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 27 assessments (21.1% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 27/128). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 6 assessments (22.2% of all those eligible for PrEP, 6/27).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    04/2023 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    6 \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    17.6% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    15 \n    15 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    6.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    19 \n    19 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    21.1% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    18.2% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    42.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    6 \n    5 \n    83.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    37.5% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    15 \n    6 \n    40.0% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    13 \n    9 \n    69.2% \n    4 \n    44.4% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    8 \n    6 \n    75.0% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    144 \n    128 \n    88.9% \n    27 \n    21.1% \n    6 \n    22.2% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Alaa has conducted (n = 55), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/55). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/10) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/45).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Alaa has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Alaa’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/55), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/10) and 0.00% for EHE (0/45).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    55 \n    10 \n    45 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Alaa has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/55), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Alaa currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/55). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Alaa is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Alaa does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Alaa, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Alaa has been involved with is 33 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Alaa’s cases that were “eligible” were 25 eligible LTC cases (75.8% of all LTC cases, 25/33). Alaa currently has an open case load of 5 open cases (20.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 5/25), with 3 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (60.0% of all open LTC cases, 3/5). Therefore, Alaa has successfully closed 20 LTC cases (80.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 20/25), with a total of 9 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (45.0% of all closed LTC cases, 9/20). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    33 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    25 \n    75.8% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    5 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    3 \n    60.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    20 \n    80.0% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    9 \n    45.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Alaa’s HIV linkage cases.\nAlaa has worked on a total of 13 HIV linkage cases (39.4% of all linkage cases, 13/33). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 0 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/13), and a total of 13 for those that have been previously diagnosed (100.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 13/13).\nA total of 8 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (61.5% of all HIV linkage cases, 8/13), and the reasons the remaining 5 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 0 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/8), and 8 were for those previously diagnosed (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 8/8). Alaa is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 8 thus far (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 8/8). Out of those cases closed, a total of 3 were unable to be linked to care (37.5% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 3/8), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Alaa has successfully linked a total of 5 HIV linkage cases (62.5% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 5/8). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 0 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 0/0), and 5 were for those that were previously diagnosed (62.5% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 5/8).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Alaa’s HCV linkage cases.\nAlaa has worked on a total of 15 HCV linkage cases (45.5% of all linkage cases, 15/33). Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 3 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (20.0% of all HCV linkage cases, 3/15), and a total of 11 for those that have been previously diagnosed (73.3% of all HCV linkage cases, 11/15).\nA total of 12 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (80.0% of all HCV linkage cases, 12/15), and the reasons the remaining 3 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 3 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (25.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 3/12), and 8 were for those previously diagnosed (66.7% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 8/12). Alaa is currently working on 3 of these HCV linkage cases (33.3% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 9 thus far (75.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 9/12). Out of those cases closed, a total of 6 were unable to be linked to care (66.7% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 6/9), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Alaa has successfully linked a total of 3 HCV linkage cases (33.3% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 3/9). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 1 were for those newly diagnosed with HCV (33.3% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 1/3), and 2 were for those that were previously diagnosed (25.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 2/8).\n\n\nThe SUD Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Alaa’s SUD linkage cases.\nAlaa has worked on a total of 3 SUD linkage cases (9.1% of all linkage cases, 3/33).\nA total of 3 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (100.0% of all SUD linkage cases, 3/3), and the reasons the remaining 0 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nAlaa is currently working on 1 of these SUD linkage cases (100.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 2 thus far (66.7% of all “eligible” SUD linkage cases, 2/3). Out of those cases closed, a total of 1 were unable to be linked to care (50.0% of all closed SUD linkage cases, 1/2), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram.

The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Brooke during this reporting period is 77, with 54 assessments having been screened for a SUD (70.1%, 54/77). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 12 that were positive for SUD (22.2%, 12/54).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    03/2024 \n    9 \n    6 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    17 \n    11 \n    64.7% \n    1 \n    9.1% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    13 \n    7 \n    53.8% \n    1 \n    14.3% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    32 \n    25 \n    78.1% \n    8 \n    32.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    6 \n    5 \n    83.3% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    77 \n    54 \n    70.1% \n    12 \n    22.2% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 44 (57.1%, 44/77). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 44 (57.1%, 44/12). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 12), not all assessments (n = 77), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 2 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (4.5%, 2/44).

The total number of assessments Brooke conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 10 assessments (13.0% of all those assessed, 10/77). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 1 assessments (10.0% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 1/10). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 1 assessments (100.0% of all those eligible for PrEP, 1/1).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    03/2024 \n    9 \n    2 \n    22.2% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    17 \n    2 \n    11.8% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    13 \n    4 \n    30.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    32 \n    1 \n    3.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    6 \n    1 \n    16.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    77 \n    10 \n    13.0% \n    1 \n    10.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Brooke, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Brooke has conducted (n = 31), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/31). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/31) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.0% of all EHE tests, 0/0).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Brooke has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Brooke’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/31), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/31) and 0.0% for EHE (0/0).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    31 \n    31 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Brooke has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/31), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Brooke currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/31). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Brooke does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Brooke, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Brooke has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Brooke’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Brooke currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Brooke has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    0 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously.

Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 0 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and a total of 0 for those that have been previously diagnosed (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/0).\nA total of 0 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and the reasons the remaining 0 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 0 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and 0 were for those previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Brooke is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 0 thus far (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Out of those cases closed, a total of 0 were unable to be linked to care (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Brooke has successfully linked a total of 0 HIV linkage cases (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Bella has conducted a total of 245 assessments, which means that 69.6% of Bella’s encounters consisted of an assessment (245/450).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Bella during this reporting period is 245, with 213 assessments having been screened for a SUD (86.9%, 213/245). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 81 that were positive for SUD (38.0%, 81/213).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    05/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    20 \n    13 \n    65.0% \n    1 \n    7.7% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    13 \n    11 \n    84.6% \n    4 \n    36.4% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    5.9% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    25 \n    23 \n    92.0% \n    4 \n    17.4% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    18 \n    16 \n    88.9% \n    9 \n    56.2% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    20 \n    20 \n    100.0% \n    10 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    20 \n    16 \n    80.0% \n    11 \n    68.8% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    13 \n    12 \n    92.3% \n    6 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    35 \n    31 \n    88.6% \n    11 \n    35.5% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    57 \n    48 \n    84.2% \n    21 \n    43.8% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    4 \n    3 \n    75.0% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    245 \n    213 \n    86.9% \n    81 \n    38.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 142 (58.0%, 142/245). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 143 (58.4%, 143/81). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 81), not all assessments (n = 245), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 20 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (14.0%, 20/143).

The total number of assessments Bella conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 122 assessments (49.8% of all those assessed, 122/245). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 29 assessments (23.8% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 29/122). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 1 assessments (3.4% of all those eligible for PrEP, 1/29).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    05/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    20 \n    3 \n    15.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    13 \n    3 \n    23.1% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    17 \n    12 \n    70.6% \n    5 \n    41.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    25 \n    13 \n    52.0% \n    2 \n    15.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    18 \n    14 \n    77.8% \n    4 \n    28.6% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    20 \n    13 \n    65.0% \n    3 \n    23.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    20 \n    13 \n    65.0% \n    2 \n    15.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    13 \n    10 \n    76.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    35 \n    18 \n    51.4% \n    5 \n    27.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    57 \n    19 \n    33.3% \n    5 \n    26.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    4 \n    1 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    245 \n    122 \n    49.8% \n    29 \n    23.8% \n    1 \n    3.4% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Bella has conducted (n = 125), there have been 1 positive tests (0.80% of all HIV tests, 1/125). There have been a total of 1 positive CTR tests (0.80% of all CTR tests, 1/125) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.0% of all EHE tests, 0/0).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Bella has identified a total of 1 new positive individuals (100.0% of all positive HIV tests, 1/1). This number is comprised of 1 new positives from CTR testing (100.00% percent of all CTR positive tests, 1/1) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Bella’s HIV testing is 0.80% (1/125), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.80% for CTR (1/125) and 0.0% for EHE (0/0).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    125 \n    125 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.80% \n    0.80% \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Bella has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/125), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Bella currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/125). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up.

Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.\nThere are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Bella is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Bella does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Bella, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Bella has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Bella’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Bella currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Bella has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    0 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously.

The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Carmen has conducted a total of 47 assessments, which means that 12.5% of Carmen’s encounters consisted of an assessment (47/452).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Carmen during this reporting period is 47, with 39 assessments having been screened for a SUD (83.0%, 39/47).

If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 35 (74.5%, 35/47). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 35 (74.5%, 35/27). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 27), not all assessments (n = 47), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 5 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (14.3%, 5/35).

Prophylaxis (PrEP)\nPrEP eligibility is covered by several different questions scattered within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Carmen conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 41 assessments (87.2% of all those assessed, 41/47). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 13 assessments (31.7% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 13/41). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 8 assessments (61.5% of all those eligible for PrEP, 8/13).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    06/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    5 \n    4 \n    80.0% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    10 \n    10 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    5 \n    3 \n    60.0% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    6 \n    4 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    75.0% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    47 \n    41 \n    87.2% \n    13 \n    31.7% \n    8 \n    61.5% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Carmen, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Carmen has conducted (n = 87), there have been 2 positive tests (2.30% of all HIV tests, 2/87). There have been a total of 2 positive CTR tests (2.30% of all CTR tests, 2/87) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.0% of all EHE tests, 0/0).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Carmen has identified a total of 1 new positive individuals (50.0% of all positive HIV tests, 1/2). This number is comprised of 1 new positives from CTR testing (50.00% percent of all CTR positive tests, 1/2) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Carmen’s HIV testing is 1.15% (1/87), and for each program specifically is as follows: 1.15% for CTR (1/87) and 0.0% for EHE (0/0).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    87 \n    87 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    2 \n    2 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    1.15% \n    1.15% \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Carmen has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/87), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Carmen currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/87). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up. Even if referrals are provided during the linkage process, they are represented here as any information gathered during the encounter could have led to that referral being provided.

Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.\nThere are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list. Those referral types are indicated within the table to the left as well as the figure below, and listed here: primary care (PCP), ED social work (SW), and Peer services.\nThe table to the left highlights the total number of referrals provided during the initial encounter as well as the total number of referrals provided during the linkage follow-up. These referrals do not necessarily mean that Carmen is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Carmen does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Carmen, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Carmen has been involved with is 4 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Carmen’s cases that were “eligible” were 4 eligible LTC cases (100.0% of all LTC cases, 4/4). Carmen currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/4), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Christine has conducted a total of 33 assessments, which means that 73.3% of Christine’s encounters consisted of an assessment (33/51).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Christine during this reporting period is 33, with 33 assessments having been screened for a SUD (100.0%, 33/33). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 5 that were positive for SUD (15.2%, 5/33).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    03/2024 \n    14 \n    14 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    14.3% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    19 \n    19 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    15.8% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    33 \n    33 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    15.2% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 32 (97.0%, 32/33). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 32 (97.0%, 32/5). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 5), not all assessments (n = 33), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/32).

The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 4 assessments (12.5% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 4/32). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered.

This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Christine’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/14), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/14) and 0.0% for EHE (0/0).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    14 \n    14 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Christine has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/14), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Christine currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/14). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Christine is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved.

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Christine does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Christine, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Christine has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Christine’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Christine currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Christine has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0).

The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Cameron has conducted a total of 58 assessments, which means that 50.4% of Cameron’s encounters consisted of an assessment (58/135).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Cameron during this reporting period is 58, with 52 assessments having been screened for a SUD (89.7%, 52/58). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 17 that were positive for SUD (32.7%, 17/52).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    03/2024 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    13 \n    12 \n    92.3% \n    3 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    19 \n    14 \n    73.7% \n    4 \n    28.6% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    21 \n    21 \n    100.0% \n    8 \n    38.1% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    58 \n    52 \n    89.7% \n    17 \n    32.7% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 47 (81.0%, 47/58). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 48 (82.8%, 48/17). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 17), not all assessments (n = 58), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 21 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (43.8%, 21/48).

The total number of assessments Cameron conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 52 assessments (89.7% of all those assessed, 52/58). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 14 assessments (26.9% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 14/52). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 0 assessments (0.0% of all those eligible for PrEP, 0/14).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    03/2024 \n    5 \n    3 \n    60.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    13 \n    11 \n    84.6% \n    4 \n    36.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    19 \n    18 \n    94.7% \n    3 \n    16.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    21 \n    20 \n    95.2% \n    6 \n    30.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    58 \n    52 \n    89.7% \n    14 \n    26.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging.

There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/36) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.0% of all EHE tests, 0/0).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Cameron has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Cameron’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/36), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/36) and 0.0% for EHE (0/0).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    36 \n    36 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Cameron has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/36), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Cameron currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/36). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Cameron does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Cameron, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Cameron has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Cameron’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Cameron currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Cameron has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Chloe has conducted a total of 275 assessments, which means that 81.8% of Chloe’s encounters consisted of an assessment (275/567).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Chloe during this reporting period is 275, with 256 assessments having been screened for a SUD (93.1%, 256/275). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 0 that were positive for SUD (0.0%, 0/256).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    16 \n    15 \n    93.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    25 \n    22 \n    88.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    23 \n    22 \n    95.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    38 \n    37 \n    97.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    14 \n    14 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    24 \n    21 \n    87.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    12 \n    9 \n    75.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    9 \n    7 \n    77.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    18 \n    17 \n    94.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    11 \n    10 \n    90.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    12 \n    11 \n    91.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    16 \n    14 \n    87.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    275 \n    256 \n    93.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 0 (0.0%, 0/275). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 0 (0.0%, 0/0). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 0), not all assessments (n = 275), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (NA, 0/0).

Prophylaxis (PrEP)\nPrEP eligibility is covered by several different questions scattered within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Chloe conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 272 assessments (98.9% of all those assessed, 272/275). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 121 assessments (44.5% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 121/272). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 76 assessments (62.8% of all those eligible for PrEP, 76/121).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    16 \n    16 \n    100.0% \n    8 \n    50.0% \n    4 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    25 \n    25 \n    100.0% \n    10 \n    40.0% \n    9 \n    90.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    23 \n    23 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    30.4% \n    3 \n    42.9% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    38 \n    37 \n    97.4% \n    14 \n    37.8% \n    10 \n    71.4% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    22.2% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    29.4% \n    4 \n    80.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    14 \n    14 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    50.0% \n    3 \n    42.9% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    24 \n    24 \n    100.0% \n    9 \n    37.5% \n    3 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    12 \n    12 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    25.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    50.0% \n    3 \n    75.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    62.5% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    18 \n    17 \n    94.4% \n    14 \n    82.4% \n    7 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    45.5% \n    4 \n    80.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    87.5% \n    6 \n    85.7% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    12 \n    11 \n    91.7% \n    6 \n    54.5% \n    6 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    42.9% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    16 \n    16 \n    100.0% \n    9 \n    56.2% \n    6 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    275 \n    272 \n    98.9% \n    121 \n    44.5% \n    76 \n    62.8% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Chloe, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Chloe has conducted (n = 330), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/330). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/132) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/198).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Chloe has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Chloe’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/330), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/132) and 0.00% for EHE (0/198).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    330 \n    132 \n    198 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Chloe has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/330), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Chloe currently has a total of 1 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.3% of all HIV tests, 1/330). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.\nThere are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Chloe is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Chloe does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Chloe, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Chloe has been involved with is 233 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Chloe’s cases that were “eligible” were 171 eligible LTC cases (73.4% of all LTC cases, 171/233). Chloe currently has an open case load of 13 open cases (7.6% of all eligible LTC cases, 13/171), with 2 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (15.4% of all open LTC cases, 2/13). Therefore, Chloe has successfully closed 158 LTC cases (92.4% of all eligible LTC cases, 158/171), with a total of 50 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (31.6% of all closed LTC cases, 50/158). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below.

Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 6 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (11.5% of all HIV linkage cases, 6/52), and a total of 46 for those that have been previously diagnosed (88.5% of all HIV linkage cases, 46/52).\nA total of 31 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (59.6% of all HIV linkage cases, 31/52), and the reasons the remaining 21 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 6 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (19.4% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 6/31), and 25 were for those previously diagnosed (80.6% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 25/31). Chloe is currently working on 1 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 30 thus far (96.8% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 30/31). Out of those cases closed, a total of 16 were unable to be linked to care (53.3% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 16/30), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Dylanne has conducted a total of 0 assessments, which means that NA of Dylanne’s encounters consisted of an assessment (0/0).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Dylanne during this reporting period is 0, with 0 assessments having been screened for a SUD (NA, 0/0). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 0 that were positive for SUD (NA, 0/0).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    0 \n    0 \n    NA \n    0 \n    NA \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 0 (NA, 0/0). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 0 (NA, 0/0). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 0), not all assessments (n = 0), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (NA, 0/0).

The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 0 assessments (NA of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 0/0). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered.

Dylanne has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (NA of all HIV tests, 0/0), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Dylanne currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (NA of all HIV tests, 0/0). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up. Even if referrals are provided during the linkage process, they are represented here as any information gathered during the encounter could have led to that referral being provided.

Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.\nThere are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Dylanne is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least.

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Dylanne does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Dylanne, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Dylanne has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Dylanne’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Dylanne currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Dylanne has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0).

The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Joseph has conducted a total of 187 assessments, which means that 65.2% of Joseph’s encounters consisted of an assessment (187/576).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Joseph during this reporting period is 187, with 180 assessments having been screened for a SUD (96.3%, 180/187). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 106 that were positive for SUD (58.9%, 106/180).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    9 \n    8 \n    88.9% \n    7 \n    87.5% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    12 \n    12 \n    100.0% \n    9 \n    75.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    10 \n    9 \n    90.0% \n    5 \n    55.6% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    14 \n    12 \n    85.7% \n    8 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    10 \n    10 \n    100.0% \n    8 \n    80.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    71.4% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    77.8% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    12 \n    12 \n    100.0% \n    9 \n    75.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    23 \n    22 \n    95.7% \n    10 \n    45.5% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    23 \n    23 \n    100.0% \n    9 \n    39.1% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    14 \n    14 \n    100.0% \n    10 \n    71.4% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    30 \n    30 \n    100.0% \n    15 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    60.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    2 \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    187 \n    180 \n    96.3% \n    106 \n    58.9% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 123 (65.8%, 123/187). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 123 (65.8%, 123/106). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 106), not all assessments (n = 187), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 35 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (28.5%, 35/123).

scattered within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Joseph conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 158 assessments (84.5% of all those assessed, 158/187). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 75 assessments (47.5% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 75/158). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 43 assessments (57.3% of all those eligible for PrEP, 43/75).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    9 \n    8 \n    88.9% \n    4 \n    50.0% \n    4 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    12 \n    12 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    41.7% \n    3 \n    60.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    10 \n    7 \n    70.0% \n    4 \n    57.1% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    14 \n    10 \n    71.4% \n    4 \n    40.0% \n    3 \n    75.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    10 \n    10 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    40.0% \n    3 \n    75.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    57.1% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    9 \n    8 \n    88.9% \n    4 \n    50.0% \n    4 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    12 \n    11 \n    91.7% \n    7 \n    63.6% \n    4 \n    57.1% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    23 \n    17 \n    73.9% \n    3 \n    17.6% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    23 \n    21 \n    91.3% \n    6 \n    28.6% \n    4 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    14 \n    11 \n    78.6% \n    7 \n    63.6% \n    3 \n    42.9% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    30 \n    27 \n    90.0% \n    15 \n    55.6% \n    6 \n    40.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    5 \n    4 \n    80.0% \n    3 \n    75.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    3 \n    1 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    2 \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    2 \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    187 \n    158 \n    84.5% \n    75 \n    47.5% \n    43 \n    57.3% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Joseph, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Joseph has conducted (n = 110), there have been 3 positive tests (2.73% of all HIV tests, 3/110). There have been a total of 3 positive CTR tests (3.37% of all CTR tests, 3/89) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/21).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Joseph has identified a total of 2 new positive individuals (66.7% of all positive HIV tests, 2/3). This number is comprised of 2 new positives from CTR testing (66.67% percent of all CTR positive tests, 2/3) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Joseph’s HIV testing is 1.82% (2/110), and for each program specifically is as follows: 2.25% for CTR (2/89) and 0.00% for EHE (0/21).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    110 \n    89 \n    21 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    3 \n    3 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    2 \n    2 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    1.82% \n    2.25% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Joseph has had a total of 1 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.9% of all HIV tests, 1/110), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Joseph currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/110). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up. Even if referrals are provided during the linkage process, they are represented here as any information gathered during the encounter could have led to that referral being provided.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Joseph is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Joseph does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Joseph, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Joseph has been involved with is 197 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Joseph’s cases that were “eligible” were 163 eligible LTC cases (82.7% of all LTC cases, 163/197). Joseph currently has an open case load of 20 open cases (12.3% of all eligible LTC cases, 20/163), with 1 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (5.0% of all open LTC cases, 1/20). Therefore, Joseph has successfully closed 143 LTC cases (87.7% of all eligible LTC cases, 143/163), with a total of 36 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (25.2% of all closed LTC cases, 36/143). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    197 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    163 \n    82.7% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    20 \n    12.3% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    1 \n    5.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    143 \n    87.7% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    36 \n    25.2% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Joseph’s HIV linkage cases.\nJoseph has worked on a total of 9 HIV linkage cases (4.6% of all linkage cases, 9/197). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 2 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (22.2% of all HIV linkage cases, 2/9), and a total of 7 for those that have been previously diagnosed (77.8% of all HIV linkage cases, 7/9).\nA total of 3 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (33.3% of all HIV linkage cases, 3/9), and the reasons the remaining 6 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 2 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (66.7% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 2/3), and 1 were for those previously diagnosed (33.3% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 1/3). Joseph is currently working on 1 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 2 thus far (66.7% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 2/3). Out of those cases closed, a total of 0 were unable to be linked to care (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/2), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Joseph has successfully linked a total of 2 HIV linkage cases (100.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 2/2). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 2 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 2/2), and 0 were for those that were previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 0/1).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously.

Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 76 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (40.2% of all HCV linkage cases, 76/189), and a total of 112 for those that have been previously diagnosed (59.3% of all HCV linkage cases, 112/189).\nA total of 161 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (85.2% of all HCV linkage cases, 161/189), and the reasons the remaining 28 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 64 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (39.8% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 64/161), and 96 were for those previously diagnosed (59.6% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 96/161). Joseph is currently working on 19 of these HCV linkage cases (5.3% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 142 thus far (88.2% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 142/161). Out of those cases closed, a total of 109 were unable to be linked to care (76.8% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 109/142), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Joseph has successfully linked a total of 33 HCV linkage cases (23.2% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 33/142). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 15 were for those newly diagnosed with HCV (23.4% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 15/64), and 18 were for those that were previously diagnosed (18.8% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 18/96).\n\n\nThe SUD Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Joseph’s SUD linkage cases.\nJoseph has worked on a total of 8 SUD linkage cases (4.1% of all linkage cases, 8/197).\nA total of 3 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (37.5% of all SUD linkage cases, 3/8), and the reasons the remaining 5 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nJoseph is currently working on 0 of these SUD linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 3 thus far (100.0% of all “eligible” SUD linkage cases, 3/3).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Katie has conducted a total of 252 assessments, which means that 77.1% of Katie’s encounters consisted of an assessment (252/729).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Katie during this reporting period is 252, with 241 assessments having been screened for a SUD (95.6%, 241/252). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 6 that were positive for SUD (2.5%, 6/241).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    05/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    15 \n    15 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    63 \n    61 \n    96.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    28 \n    26 \n    92.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    24 \n    23 \n    95.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    20 \n    19 \n    95.0% \n    1 \n    5.3% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    26 \n    25 \n    96.2% \n    2 \n    8.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    29 \n    29 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    6.9% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    14 \n    13 \n    92.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    22 \n    20 \n    90.9% \n    1 \n    5.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    252 \n    241 \n    95.6% \n    6 \n    2.5% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 216 (85.7%, 216/252). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 216 (85.7%, 216/6). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 6), not all assessments (n = 252), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 3 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (1.4%, 3/216).

whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Katie conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 208 assessments (82.5% of all those assessed, 208/252). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 64 assessments (30.8% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 64/208). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 3 assessments (4.7% of all those eligible for PrEP, 3/64).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    05/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    15 \n    13 \n    86.7% \n    8 \n    61.5% \n    1 \n    12.5% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    63 \n    49 \n    77.8% \n    13 \n    26.5% \n    1 \n    7.7% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    28 \n    23 \n    82.1% \n    4 \n    17.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    7 \n    6 \n    85.7% \n    3 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    24 \n    19 \n    79.2% \n    4 \n    21.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    20 \n    15 \n    75.0% \n    7 \n    46.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    26 \n    25 \n    96.2% \n    7 \n    28.0% \n    1 \n    14.3% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    29 \n    26 \n    89.7% \n    3 \n    11.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    14 \n    12 \n    85.7% \n    3 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    22 \n    17 \n    77.3% \n    5 \n    29.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    3 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    300.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    252 \n    208 \n    82.5% \n    64 \n    30.8% \n    3 \n    4.7% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Katie has conducted (n = 148), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/148). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/128) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/20).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Katie has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Katie’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/148), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/128) and 0.00% for EHE (0/20).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    148 \n    128 \n    20 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Katie has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/148), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Katie currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/148). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Katie is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least.

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Katie does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Katie, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Katie has been involved with is 176 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Katie’s cases that were “eligible” were 142 eligible LTC cases (80.7% of all LTC cases, 142/176). Katie currently has an open case load of 22 open cases (15.5% of all eligible LTC cases, 22/142), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/22). Therefore, Katie has successfully closed 120 LTC cases (84.5% of all eligible LTC cases, 120/142), with a total of 28 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (23.3% of all closed LTC cases, 28/120). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    176 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    142 \n    80.7% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    22 \n    15.5% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    120 \n    84.5% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    28 \n    23.3% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously.

Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 1 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (16.7% of all HIV linkage cases, 1/6), and a total of 5 for those that have been previously diagnosed (83.3% of all HIV linkage cases, 5/6).\nA total of 3 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (50.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 3/6), and the reasons the remaining 3 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 1 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (33.3% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 1/3), and 2 were for those previously diagnosed (66.7% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 2/3). Katie is currently working on 1 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 2 thus far (66.7% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 2/3). Out of those cases closed, a total of 2 were unable to be linked to care (100.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 2/2), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Katie has successfully linked a total of 0 HIV linkage cases (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/2).

Katie is currently working on 18 of these HCV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 100 thus far (84.7% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 100/118).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Katie has conducted a total of 380 assessments, which means that 54.3% of Katie’s encounters consisted of an assessment (380/1015).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Katie during this reporting period is 380, with 360 assessments having been screened for a SUD (94.7%, 360/380). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 126 that were positive for SUD (35.0%, 126/360).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    16 \n    16 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    6 \n    4 \n    66.7% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    11 \n    10 \n    90.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    14.3% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    10 \n    7 \n    70.0% \n    2 \n    28.6% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    37 \n    34 \n    91.9% \n    5 \n    14.7% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    15 \n    15 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    32 \n    29 \n    90.6% \n    10 \n    34.5% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    15 \n    13 \n    86.7% \n    2 \n    15.4% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    31 \n    31 \n    100.0% \n    8 \n    25.8% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    29.4% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    29 \n    28 \n    96.6% \n    16 \n    57.1% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    24 \n    24 \n    100.0% \n    11 \n    45.8% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    31 \n    30 \n    96.8% \n    15 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    35 \n    34 \n    97.1% \n    16 \n    47.1% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    16 \n    16 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    37.5% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    22 \n    19 \n    86.4% \n    12 \n    63.2% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    21 \n    21 \n    100.0% \n    10 \n    47.6% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    60.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    380 \n    360 \n    94.7% \n    126 \n    35.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 167 (43.9%, 167/380). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 168 (44.2%, 168/126). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 126), not all assessments (n = 380), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 21 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (12.5%, 21/168).

determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Katie conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 280 assessments (73.7% of all those assessed, 280/380). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 86 assessments (30.7% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 86/280). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 12 assessments (14.0% of all those eligible for PrEP, 12/86).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    16 \n    8 \n    50.0% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    6 \n    3 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    11 \n    7 \n    63.6% \n    2 \n    28.6% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    10 \n    8 \n    80.0% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    37 \n    21 \n    56.8% \n    8 \n    38.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    15 \n    6 \n    40.0% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    32 \n    22 \n    68.8% \n    4 \n    18.2% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    15 \n    12 \n    80.0% \n    4 \n    33.3% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    31 \n    23 \n    74.2% \n    8 \n    34.8% \n    1 \n    12.5% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    17 \n    15 \n    88.2% \n    5 \n    33.3% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    29 \n    23 \n    79.3% \n    11 \n    47.8% \n    1 \n    9.1% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    24 \n    24 \n    100.0% \n    11 \n    45.8% \n    3 \n    27.3% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    31 \n    23 \n    74.2% \n    4 \n    17.4% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    35 \n    26 \n    74.3% \n    7 \n    26.9% \n    2 \n    28.6% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    16 \n    12 \n    75.0% \n    3 \n    25.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    22 \n    19 \n    86.4% \n    8 \n    42.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    21 \n    17 \n    81.0% \n    5 \n    29.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    5 \n    4 \n    80.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    380 \n    280 \n    73.7% \n    86 \n    30.7% \n    12 \n    14.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Katie, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Katie has conducted (n = 346), there have been 3 positive tests (0.87% of all HIV tests, 3/346). There have been a total of 3 positive CTR tests (1.08% of all CTR tests, 3/278) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/68).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Katie has identified a total of 1 new positive individuals (33.3% of all positive HIV tests, 1/3). This number is comprised of 1 new positives from CTR testing (33.33% percent of all CTR positive tests, 1/3) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Katie’s HIV testing is 0.29% (1/346), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.36% for CTR (1/278) and 0.00% for EHE (0/68).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    346 \n    278 \n    68 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    3 \n    3 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.29% \n    0.36% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Katie has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/346), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Katie currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/346). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Katie is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Katie does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Katie, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Katie has been involved with is 26 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Katie’s cases that were “eligible” were 23 eligible LTC cases (88.5% of all LTC cases, 23/26). Katie currently has an open case load of 5 open cases (21.7% of all eligible LTC cases, 5/23), with 4 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (80.0% of all open LTC cases, 4/5). Therefore, Katie has successfully closed 20 LTC cases (87.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 20/23), with a total of 7 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (35.0% of all closed LTC cases, 7/20). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    26 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    23 \n    88.5% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    5 \n    21.7% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    4 \n    80.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    20 \n    87.0% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    7 \n    35.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Katie’s HIV linkage cases.\nKatie has worked on a total of 1 HIV linkage cases (3.8% of all linkage cases, 1/26). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 1 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (100.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 1/1), and a total of 0 for those that have been previously diagnosed (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/1).\nA total of 1 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (100.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 1/1), and the reasons the remaining 0 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 1 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 1/1), and 0 were for those previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/1). Katie is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 1 thus far (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 1/1). Out of those cases closed, a total of 0 were unable to be linked to care (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/1), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Katie has successfully linked a total of 1 HIV linkage cases (100.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 1/1).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Kathy has conducted a total of 6 assessments, which means that 60.0% of Kathy’s encounters consisted of an assessment (6/256).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Kathy during this reporting period is 6, with 5 assessments having been screened for a SUD (83.3%, 5/6). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 4 that were positive for SUD (80.0%, 4/5).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    06/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    2 \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    6 \n    5 \n    83.3% \n    4 \n    80.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 3 (50.0%, 3/6). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 3 (50.0%, 3/4). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 4), not all assessments (n = 6), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 1 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (33.3%, 1/3).

The total number of assessments Kathy conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 6 assessments (100.0% of all those assessed, 6/6). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 21 assessments (350.0% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 21/6). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 2 assessments (9.5% of all those eligible for PrEP, 2/21).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    06/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    600.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    300.0% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    6 \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    21 \n    350.0% \n    2 \n    9.5% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Kathy, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Kathy has conducted (n = 3), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/3). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/3) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.0% of all EHE tests, 0/0).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Kathy has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Kathy’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/3), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/3) and 0.0% for EHE (0/0).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    3 \n    3 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Kathy has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/3), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Kathy currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/3). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up. Even if referrals are provided during the linkage process, they are represented here as any information gathered during the encounter could have led to that referral being provided.

Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.\nThere are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Kathy is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Kathy does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Kathy, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Kathy has been involved with is 75 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Kathy’s cases that were “eligible” were 58 eligible LTC cases (77.3% of all LTC cases, 58/75). Kathy currently has an open case load of 1 open cases (1.7% of all eligible LTC cases, 1/58), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/1). Therefore, Kathy has successfully closed 57 LTC cases (98.3% of all eligible LTC cases, 57/58), with a total of 43 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (75.4% of all closed LTC cases, 43/57). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    75 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    58 \n    77.3% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    1 \n    1.7% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    57 \n    98.3% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    43 \n    75.4% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Kathy’s HIV linkage cases.\nKathy has worked on a total of 1 HIV linkage cases (1.3% of all linkage cases, 1/75). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 0 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/1), and a total of 1 for those that have been previously diagnosed (100.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 1/1).\nA total of 0 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/1), and the reasons the remaining 1 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 0 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and 0 were for those previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Kathy is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 0 thus far (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Out of those cases closed, a total of 0 were unable to be linked to care (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Kathy has successfully linked a total of 0 HIV linkage cases (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 0 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 0/0), and 0 were for those that were previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 0/0).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Kathy’s HCV linkage cases.\nKathy has worked on a total of 4 HCV linkage cases (5.3% of all linkage cases, 4/75). Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 3 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (75.0% of all HCV linkage cases, 3/4), and a total of 1 for those that have been previously diagnosed (25.0% of all HCV linkage cases, 1/4).\nA total of 3 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (75.0% of all HCV linkage cases, 3/4), and the reasons the remaining 1 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 2 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (66.7% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 2/3), and 1 were for those previously diagnosed (33.3% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 1/3). Kathy is currently working on 0 of these HCV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 3 thus far (100.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 3/3). Out of those cases closed, a total of 3 were unable to be linked to care (100.0% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 3/3), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram.

The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Lauren has conducted a total of 106 assessments, which means that 82.8% of Lauren’s encounters consisted of an assessment (106/218).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Lauren during this reporting period is 106, with 101 assessments having been screened for a SUD (95.3%, 101/106).

If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 0 (0.0%, 0/106). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 0 (0.0%, 0/0). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 0), not all assessments (n = 106), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (NA, 0/0).

\n\n\nPre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\nPrEP eligibility is covered by several different questions scattered within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Lauren conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 101 assessments (95.3% of all those assessed, 101/106). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 66 assessments (65.3% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 66/101). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 39 assessments (59.1% of all those eligible for PrEP, 39/66).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    10 \n    10 \n    100.0% \n    8 \n    80.0% \n    5 \n    62.5% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    71.4% \n    5 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    16 \n    16 \n    100.0% \n    8 \n    50.0% \n    5 \n    62.5% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    85.7% \n    5 \n    83.3% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    77.8% \n    3 \n    42.9% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    80.0% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    8 \n    7 \n    87.5% \n    3 \n    42.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    12 \n    12 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    41.7% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    7 \n    6 \n    85.7% \n    5 \n    83.3% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    4 \n    3 \n    75.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    6 \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    50.0% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    2 \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    106 \n    101 \n    95.3% \n    66 \n    65.3% \n    39 \n    59.1% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

    "text": "HIV Testing\nThe total number of HIV tests, including both CTR and EHE tests, are shown in the plot below. These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Lauren, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Lauren has conducted (n = 129), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/129). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/113) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/16).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Lauren has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Lauren’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/129), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/113) and 0.00% for EHE (0/16).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    129 \n    113 \n    16 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Lauren has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/129), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Lauren currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/129). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

    "text": "Referrals\nReferral information can be provided to patients/clients regardless of what occurs during their encounter, and regardless of whether or not they received any EIP services during their encounter. They may be provided based on brief conversations with our staff or from information gathered from medical staff that may not have been documented within the EIP database. Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up. Even if referrals are provided during the linkage process, they are represented here as any information gathered during the encounter could have led to that referral being provided. The referrals will be noted separately, but also as a combined total, and the referrals provided specifically during the linkage process will be repeated in the linkage to care section.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Encounter referral \n    Linkage referral \n  \n \n\n  \n    HIV \n    75 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    Hepatitis C \n    70 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    SUD \n    88 \n    12 \n  \n  \n    Human Trafficking \n    56 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Mental Health \n    59 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Housing \n    65 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    PrEP \n    72 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    STI \n    41 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Food services \n    60 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    Financial assistance \n    28 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Person abuse \n    50 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    General health \n    64 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    PCP* \n    52 \n     \n  \n  \n    ED SW* \n    13 \n     \n  \n  \n    Peer services* \n    119 \n     \n  \n  \n    Other \n    2 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    914 \n    16 \n  \n\n\n* No linkage referral documentation\n\n\n\n\n\nReferrals are documented in the EIP database in three different ways at the encounter level: (1) provided information, such as brochures/pamphlets or referral lists with community programs, (2) provided internal referral for that service to one of EIP’s linkage coordinators, or (3) an external referral to a specific agency. Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.\nThere are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list. Those referral types are indicated within the table to the left as well as the figure below, and listed here: primary care (PCP), ED social work (SW), and Peer services.\nThe table to the left highlights the total number of referrals provided during the initial encounter as well as the total number of referrals provided during the linkage follow-up. These referrals do not necessarily mean that Lauren is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "section": "Linkage to Care",
    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Lauren does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Lauren, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Lauren has been involved with is 51 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Lauren’s cases that were “eligible” were 15 eligible LTC cases (29.4% of all LTC cases, 15/51). Lauren currently has an open case load of 1 open cases (6.7% of all eligible LTC cases, 1/15), with 1 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (100.0% of all open LTC cases, 1/1). Therefore, Lauren has successfully closed 14 LTC cases (93.3% of all eligible LTC cases, 14/15), with a total of 6 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (42.9% of all closed LTC cases, 6/14). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    51 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    15 \n    29.4% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    1 \n    6.7% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    14 \n    93.3% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    6 \n    42.9% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Lauren’s HIV linkage cases.\nLauren has worked on a total of 0 HIV linkage cases (0.0% of all linkage cases, 0/51). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 0 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and a total of 0 for those that have been previously diagnosed (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/0).\nA total of 0 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and the reasons the remaining 0 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 0 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and 0 were for those previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Lauren is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 0 thus far (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Out of those cases closed, a total of 0 were unable to be linked to care (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Lauren has successfully linked a total of 0 HIV linkage cases (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 0 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 0/0), and 0 were for those that were previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 0/0).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Lauren’s HCV linkage cases.\nLauren has worked on a total of 2 HCV linkage cases (3.9% of all linkage cases, 2/51). Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 0 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (0.0% of all HCV linkage cases, 0/2), and a total of 1 for those that have been previously diagnosed (50.0% of all HCV linkage cases, 1/2).\nA total of 1 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (50.0% of all HCV linkage cases, 1/2), and the reasons the remaining 1 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 0 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (0.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 0/1), and 0 were for those previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 0/1). Lauren is currently working on 1 of these HCV linkage cases (100.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 0 thus far (0.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 0/1). Out of those cases closed, a total of 0 were unable to be linked to care (0.0% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 0/0), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Meg has conducted a total of 387 assessments, which means that 68.3% of Meg’s encounters consisted of an assessment (387/995).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Meg during this reporting period is 387, with 375 assessments having been screened for a SUD (96.9%, 375/387). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 112 that were positive for SUD (29.9%, 112/375).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    25 \n    25 \n    100.0% \n    8 \n    32.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    26 \n    26 \n    100.0% \n    8 \n    30.8% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    27 \n    26 \n    96.3% \n    13 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    44 \n    41 \n    93.2% \n    7 \n    17.1% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    32 \n    31 \n    96.9% \n    12 \n    38.7% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    27 \n    26 \n    96.3% \n    6 \n    23.1% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    23 \n    22 \n    95.7% \n    8 \n    36.4% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    19 \n    18 \n    94.7% \n    5 \n    27.8% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    25 \n    24 \n    96.0% \n    10 \n    41.7% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    13 \n    12 \n    92.3% \n    1 \n    8.3% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    45.5% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    26 \n    26 \n    100.0% \n    9 \n    34.6% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    10 \n    10 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    28 \n    28 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    14 \n    14 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    28.6% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    22 \n    21 \n    95.5% \n    6 \n    28.6% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    12.5% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    7 \n    6 \n    85.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    387 \n    375 \n    96.9% \n    112 \n    29.9% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 292 (75.5%, 292/387). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 292 (75.5%, 292/112). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 112), not all assessments (n = 387), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 4 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (1.4%, 4/292). In regards to the specific conditions that were assessed, those are provided below the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    Brief MH Assessed \n    % Brief MH Assessed \n    SUD +

whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Meg conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 322 assessments (83.2% of all those assessed, 322/387). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 96 assessments (29.8% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 96/322). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 38 assessments (39.6% of all those eligible for PrEP, 38/96).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    25 \n    23 \n    92.0% \n    3 \n    13.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    26 \n    25 \n    96.2% \n    7 \n    28.0% \n    5 \n    71.4% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    27 \n    22 \n    81.5% \n    2 \n    9.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    44 \n    38 \n    86.4% \n    8 \n    21.1% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    32 \n    27 \n    84.4% \n    10 \n    37.0% \n    5 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    27 \n    24 \n    88.9% \n    6 \n    25.0% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    23 \n    18 \n    78.3% \n    6 \n    33.3% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    19 \n    12 \n    63.2% \n    6 \n    50.0% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    25 \n    22 \n    88.0% \n    10 \n    45.5% \n    8 \n    80.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    13 \n    9 \n    69.2% \n    5 \n    55.6% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    36.4% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    26 \n    19 \n    73.1% \n    6 \n    31.6% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    10 \n    6 \n    60.0% \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    28 \n    26 \n    92.9% \n    4 \n    15.4% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    14 \n    14 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    35.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    22 \n    16 \n    72.7% \n    6 \n    37.5% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    8 \n    6 \n    75.0% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    7 \n    4 \n    57.1% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    387 \n    322 \n    83.2% \n    96 \n    29.8% \n    38 \n    39.6% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/105) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/34).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Meg has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Meg’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/139), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/105) and 0.00% for EHE (0/34).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    139 \n    105 \n    34 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Meg has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/139), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Meg currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/139). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Meg is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Meg does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Meg, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Meg has been involved with is 233 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Meg’s cases that were “eligible” were 171 eligible LTC cases (73.4% of all LTC cases, 171/233). Meg currently has an open case load of 13 open cases (7.6% of all eligible LTC cases, 13/171), with 2 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (15.4% of all open LTC cases, 2/13). Therefore, Meg has successfully closed 158 LTC cases (92.4% of all eligible LTC cases, 158/171), with a total of 50 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (31.6% of all closed LTC cases, 50/158). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    233 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    171 \n    73.4% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    13 \n    7.6% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    2 \n    15.4% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    158 \n    92.4% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    50 \n    31.6% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Meg’s HIV linkage cases.\nMeg has worked on a total of 52 HIV linkage cases (22.3% of all linkage cases, 52/233). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 6 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (11.5% of all HIV linkage cases, 6/52), and a total of 46 for those that have been previously diagnosed (88.5% of all HIV linkage cases, 46/52).\nA total of 31 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (59.6% of all HIV linkage cases, 31/52), and the reasons the remaining 21 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 6 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (19.4% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 6/31), and 25 were for those previously diagnosed (80.6% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 25/31). Meg is currently working on 1 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 30 thus far (96.8% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 30/31). Out of those cases closed, a total of 16 were unable to be linked to care (53.3% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 16/30), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Meg has successfully linked a total of 14 HIV linkage cases (46.7% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 14/30). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 6 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 6/6), and 8 were for those that were previously diagnosed (32.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 8/25).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Neria has conducted a total of 85 assessments, which means that 96.6% of Neria’s encounters consisted of an assessment (85/288).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Neria during this reporting period is 85, with 82 assessments having been screened for a SUD (96.5%, 82/85). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 4 that were positive for SUD (4.9%, 4/82).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    10 \n    10 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    19 \n    19 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    10.5% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    2 \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    2 \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    85 \n    82 \n    96.5% \n    4 \n    4.9% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 9 (10.6%, 9/85). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 9 (10.6%, 9/4). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 4), not all assessments (n = 85), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 1 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (11.1%, 1/9).

may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Neria conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 83 assessments (97.6% of all those assessed, 83/85). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 76 assessments (91.6% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 76/83). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 32 assessments (42.1% of all those eligible for PrEP, 32/76).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    62.5% \n    4 \n    80.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    10 \n    10 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    70.0% \n    4 \n    57.1% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    19 \n    19 \n    100.0% \n    13 \n    68.4% \n    11 \n    84.6% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    9 \n    52.9% \n    7 \n    77.8% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    166.7% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    2 \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    4 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    37.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    5 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    300.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    4 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    350.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    200.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    3 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    85 \n    83 \n    97.6% \n    76 \n    91.6% \n    32 \n    42.1% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/19) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/49).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Neria has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Neria’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/68), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/19) and 0.00% for EHE (0/49).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    68 \n    19 \n    49 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Neria has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/68), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Neria currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/68). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Neria is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved.

This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least.

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Neria does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Neria, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Neria has been involved with is 175 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Neria’s cases that were “eligible” were 146 eligible LTC cases (83.4% of all LTC cases, 146/175). Neria currently has an open case load of 29 open cases (19.9% of all eligible LTC cases, 29/146), with 9 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (31.0% of all open LTC cases, 9/29). Therefore, Neria has successfully closed 122 LTC cases (83.6% of all eligible LTC cases, 122/146), with a total of 57 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (46.7% of all closed LTC cases, 57/122). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    175 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    146 \n    83.4% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    29 \n    19.9% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    9 \n    31.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    122 \n    83.6% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    57 \n    46.7% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Neria’s HIV linkage cases.\nNeria has worked on a total of 8 HIV linkage cases (4.6% of all linkage cases, 8/175). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 2 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (25.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 2/8), and a total of 6 for those that have been previously diagnosed (75.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 6/8).\nA total of 4 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (50.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 4/8), and the reasons the remaining 4 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 2 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (50.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 2/4), and 2 were for those previously diagnosed (50.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 2/4). Neria is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 4 thus far (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 4/4). Out of those cases closed, a total of 1 were unable to be linked to care (25.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 1/4), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Neria has successfully linked a total of 3 HIV linkage cases (75.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 3/4). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 2 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 2/2), and 1 were for those that were previously diagnosed (50.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 1/2).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Neria’s HCV linkage cases.\nNeria has worked on a total of 17 HCV linkage cases (9.7% of all linkage cases, 17/175). Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 9 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (52.9% of all HCV linkage cases, 9/17), and a total of 7 for those that have been previously diagnosed (41.2% of all HCV linkage cases, 7/17).\nA total of 14 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (82.4% of all HCV linkage cases, 14/17), and the reasons the remaining 3 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 8 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (57.1% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 8/14), and 5 were for those previously diagnosed (35.7% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 5/14). Neria is currently working on 3 of these HCV linkage cases (66.7% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 11 thus far (78.6% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 11/14). Out of those cases closed, a total of 6 were unable to be linked to care (54.5% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 6/11), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Noah has conducted a total of 73 assessments, which means that 68.9% of Noah’s encounters consisted of an assessment (73/346).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Noah during this reporting period is 73, with 68 assessments having been screened for a SUD (93.2%, 68/73). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 6 that were positive for SUD (8.8%, 6/68).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    14.3% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    20 \n    17 \n    85.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    13 \n    12 \n    92.3% \n    1 \n    8.3% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    73 \n    68 \n    93.2% \n    6 \n    8.8% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 20 (27.4%, 20/73). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 20 (27.4%, 20/6). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 6), not all assessments (n = 73), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 1 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (5.0%, 1/20).

determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Noah conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 70 assessments (95.9% of all those assessed, 70/73). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 26 assessments (37.1% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 26/70). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 3 assessments (11.5% of all those eligible for PrEP, 3/26).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    7 \n    6 \n    85.7% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    5 \n    4 \n    80.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    200.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    20 \n    19 \n    95.0% \n    6 \n    31.6% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    13 \n    13 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    23.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    133.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    73 \n    70 \n    95.9% \n    26 \n    37.1% \n    3 \n    11.5% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/35) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/44).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Noah has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Noah’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/79), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/35) and 0.00% for EHE (0/44).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    79 \n    35 \n    44 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Noah has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/79), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Noah currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/79). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up.

Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.\nThere are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Noah is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Noah does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Noah, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Noah has been involved with is 215 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Noah’s cases that were “eligible” were 105 eligible LTC cases (48.8% of all LTC cases, 105/215). Noah currently has an open case load of 15 open cases (14.3% of all eligible LTC cases, 15/105), with 2 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (13.3% of all open LTC cases, 2/15). Therefore, Noah has successfully closed 92 LTC cases (87.6% of all eligible LTC cases, 92/105), with a total of 41 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (44.6% of all closed LTC cases, 41/92).

The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Noah’s HIV linkage cases.\nNoah has worked on a total of 5 HIV linkage cases (2.3% of all linkage cases, 5/215). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 0 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/5), and a total of 5 for those that have been previously diagnosed (100.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 5/5).\nA total of 0 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/5), and the reasons the remaining 5 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 0 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and 0 were for those previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Noah is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 0 thus far (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Out of those cases closed, a total of 0 were unable to be linked to care (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Noah has successfully linked a total of 0 HIV linkage cases (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 0 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 0/0), and 0 were for those that were previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 0/0).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Noah’s HCV linkage cases.\nNoah has worked on a total of 18 HCV linkage cases (8.4% of all linkage cases, 18/215).

Noah is currently working on 1 of these HCV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 12 thus far (92.3% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 12/13). Out of those cases closed, a total of 9 were unable to be linked to care (75.0% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 9/12), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Noah has successfully linked a total of 3 HCV linkage cases (25.0% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 3/12). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 0 were for those newly diagnosed with HCV (0.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 0/3), and 3 were for those that were previously diagnosed (30.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 3/10).\n\n\nThe SUD Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Noah’s SUD linkage cases.\nNoah has worked on a total of 212 SUD linkage cases (98.6% of all linkage cases, 212/215).\nA total of 90 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (42.5% of all SUD linkage cases, 90/212), and the reasons the remaining 122 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nNoah is currently working on 13 of these SUD linkage cases (7.7% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 77 thus far (85.6% of all “eligible” SUD linkage cases, 77/90).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Niharika has conducted a total of 74 assessments, which means that 70.5% of Niharika’s encounters consisted of an assessment (74/226).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Niharika during this reporting period is 74, with 74 assessments having been screened for a SUD (100.0%, 74/74). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 35 that were positive for SUD (47.3%, 35/74).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    10/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    12 \n    12 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    41.7% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    23 \n    23 \n    100.0% \n    10 \n    43.5% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    12.5% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    12 \n    12 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    58.3% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    8 \n    72.7% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    74 \n    74 \n    100.0% \n    35 \n    47.3% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 71 (95.9%, 71/74). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 71 (95.9%, 71/35). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 35), not all assessments (n = 74), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 4 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (5.6%, 4/71). In regards to the specific conditions that were assessed, those are provided below the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    Brief MH Assessed \n    % Brief MH Assessed \n    SUD + \n    MH Assessed \n    % MH Assessed \n    MH + \n    % MH + \n  \n \n\n  \n    10/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    3 \n    150.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    12 \n    11 \n    91.7% \n    5 \n    11 \n    220.0% \n    1 \n    9.1% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    5 \n    250.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    23 \n    22 \n    95.7% \n    10 \n    22 \n    220.0% \n    1 \n    4.5% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    8 \n    800.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    12 \n    12 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    12 \n    171.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    11 \n    10 \n    90.9% \n    8 \n    10 \n    125.0% \n    2 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    74 \n    71 \n    95.9% \n    35 \n    71 \n    95.9% \n    4 \n    5.6% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepression: total of 71 assessed (100.0% of all those assessed for MH, 71/71), with 0 positive (0.0% of all those screened for depression, 0/71).\nAnxiety: total of 66 assessed (93.0% of all those assessed for MH, 66/71), with 0 positive (0.0% of all those screened for anxiety, 0/66).\nPTSD: total of 43 assessed (60.6% of all those assessed for MH, 43/71), with 4 positive (9.3% of all those screened for PTSD, 4/43).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    MH Assessed \n    Depression Assessed \n    % Depression Assessed \n    Depression positive \n    % Depression positive \n    Anxiety Assessed \n    % Anxiety Assessed \n    Anxiety positive \n    % Anxiety positive \n    PTSD Assessed \n    % PTSD Assessed \n    PTSD positive \n    % PTSD positive \n  \n \n\n  \n    10/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    9 \n    81.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    3 \n    27.3% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    4 \n    80.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    22 \n    22 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    19 \n    86.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    12 \n    54.5% \n    1 \n    8.3% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    12 \n    12 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    12 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    7 \n    58.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    10 \n    10 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    10 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    7 \n    70.0% \n    2 \n    28.6% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    71 \n    71 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    66 \n    93.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    43 \n    60.6% \n    4 \n    9.3% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\nPrEP eligibility is covered by several different questions scattered within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Niharika conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 71 assessments (95.9% of all those assessed, 71/74). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 14 assessments (19.7% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 14/71). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 9 assessments (64.3% of all those eligible for PrEP, 9/14).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    10/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    3 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    12 \n    11 \n    91.7% \n    2 \n    18.2% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    23 \n    22 \n    95.7% \n    5 \n    22.7% \n    4 \n    80.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    12 \n    12 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    11 \n    10 \n    90.9% \n    2 \n    20.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    74 \n    71 \n    95.9% \n    14 \n    19.7% \n    9 \n    64.3% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Niharika, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Niharika has conducted (n = 5), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/5). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/4) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/1).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Niharika has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Niharika’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/5), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/4) and 0.00% for EHE (0/1).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    5 \n    4 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Niharika has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/5), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Niharika currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/5). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Niharika is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least.

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Niharika does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Niharika, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Niharika has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Niharika’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Niharika currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Niharika has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below.

Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 0 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and a total of 0 for those that have been previously diagnosed (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/0).\nA total of 0 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and the reasons the remaining 0 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 0 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and 0 were for those previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Niharika is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 0 thus far (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Pierre has conducted a total of 129 assessments, which means that 54.2% of Pierre’s encounters consisted of an assessment (129/380).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Pierre during this reporting period is 129, with 106 assessments having been screened for a SUD (82.2%, 106/129). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 33 that were positive for SUD (31.1%, 33/106).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    07/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    14 \n    13 \n    92.9% \n    3 \n    23.1% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    9 \n    7 \n    77.8% \n    4 \n    57.1% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    13 \n    13 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    23.1% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    10 \n    8 \n    80.0% \n    1 \n    12.5% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    10 \n    10 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    6 \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    7 \n    6 \n    85.7% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    17 \n    12 \n    70.6% \n    4 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    23 \n    12 \n    52.2% \n    5 \n    41.7% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    4 \n    3 \n    75.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    129 \n    106 \n    82.2% \n    33 \n    31.1% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 68 (52.7%, 68/129). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 68 (52.7%, 68/33). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 33), not all assessments (n = 129), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 3 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (4.4%, 3/68).

The total number of assessments Pierre conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 53 assessments (41.1% of all those assessed, 53/129). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 11 assessments (20.8% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 11/53). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 2 assessments (18.2% of all those eligible for PrEP, 2/11).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    07/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    14 \n    10 \n    71.4% \n    4 \n    40.0% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    9 \n    4 \n    44.4% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    13 \n    8 \n    61.5% \n    1 \n    12.5% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    4 \n    2 \n    50.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    10 \n    6 \n    60.0% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    10 \n    3 \n    30.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    8 \n    3 \n    37.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    6 \n    3 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    7 \n    1 \n    14.3% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    17 \n    5 \n    29.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    23 \n    3 \n    13.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    4 \n    1 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    129 \n    53 \n    41.1% \n    11 \n    20.8% \n    2 \n    18.2% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Pierre has conducted (n = 62), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/62). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/60) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/2).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Pierre has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Pierre’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/62), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/60) and 0.00% for EHE (0/2).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    62 \n    60 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Pierre has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/62), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Pierre currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/62). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.\nThere are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list. Those referral types are indicated within the table to the left as well as the figure below, and listed here: primary care (PCP), ED social work (SW), and Peer services.\nThe table to the left highlights the total number of referrals provided during the initial encounter as well as the total number of referrals provided during the linkage follow-up. These referrals do not necessarily mean that Pierre is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Pierre’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Pierre currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Pierre has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    0 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Pierre’s HIV linkage cases.\nPierre has worked on a total of 0 HIV linkage cases (0.0% of all linkage cases, 0/0). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 0 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and a total of 0 for those that have been previously diagnosed (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/0).\nA total of 0 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and the reasons the remaining 0 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 0 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and 0 were for those previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Pierre is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 0 thus far (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Out of those cases closed, a total of 0 were unable to be linked to care (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Pierre has successfully linked a total of 0 HIV linkage cases (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 0 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 0/0), and 0 were for those that were previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 0/0).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously.

The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Rachael has conducted a total of 276 assessments, which means that 28.1% of Rachael’s encounters consisted of an assessment (276/1289).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Rachael during this reporting period is 276, with 240 assessments having been screened for a SUD (87.0%, 240/276).

If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 222 (80.4%, 222/276). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 222 (80.4%, 222/106). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 106), not all assessments (n = 276), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 23 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (10.4%, 23/222).

the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Rachael conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 212 assessments (76.8% of all those assessed, 212/276). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 69 assessments (32.5% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 69/212). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 29 assessments (42.0% of all those eligible for PrEP, 29/69).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    75.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    7 \n    5 \n    71.4% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    10 \n    8 \n    80.0% \n    6 \n    75.0% \n    3 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    19 \n    11 \n    57.9% \n    5 \n    45.5% \n    3 \n    60.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    32 \n    22 \n    68.8% \n    6 \n    27.3% \n    3 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    15 \n    9 \n    60.0% \n    2 \n    22.2% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    13 \n    11 \n    84.6% \n    6 \n    54.5% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    20 \n    18 \n    90.0% \n    3 \n    16.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    35.3% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    11 \n    9 \n    81.8% \n    4 \n    44.4% \n    4 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    11 \n    7 \n    63.6% \n    3 \n    42.9% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    32 \n    24 \n    75.0% \n    8 \n    33.3% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    21 \n    14 \n    66.7% \n    5 \n    35.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    20 \n    15 \n    75.0% \n    2 \n    13.3% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    15 \n    13 \n    86.7% \n    4 \n    30.8% \n    3 \n    75.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    11 \n    10 \n    90.9% \n    2 \n    20.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    10 \n    7 \n    70.0% \n    2 \n    28.6% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    12.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    276 \n    212 \n    76.8% \n    69 \n    32.5% \n    29 \n    42.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Rachael, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Rachael has conducted (n = 152), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/152). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/152) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.0% of all EHE tests, 0/0).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Rachael has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Rachael’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/152), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/152) and 0.0% for EHE (0/0).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    152 \n    152 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Rachael has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/152), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Rachael currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/152). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

The referrals will be noted separately, but also as a combined total, and the referrals provided specifically during the linkage process will be repeated in the linkage to care section.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Encounter referral \n    Linkage referral \n  \n \n\n  \n    HIV \n    238 \n    4 \n  \n  \n    Hepatitis C \n    223 \n    4 \n  \n  \n    SUD \n    406 \n    19 \n  \n  \n    Human Trafficking \n    355 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Mental Health \n    400 \n    14 \n  \n  \n    Housing \n    398 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    PrEP \n    373 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    STI \n    294 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    Food services \n    399 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    Financial assistance \n    378 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Person abuse \n    350 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    General health \n    398 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    PCP* \n    178 \n     \n  \n  \n    ED SW* \n    22 \n     \n  \n  \n    Peer services* \n    71 \n     \n  \n  \n    Other \n    21 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    4504 \n    47 \n  \n\n\n* No linkage referral documentation\n\n\n\n\n\nReferrals are documented in the EIP database in three different ways at the encounter level: (1) provided information, such as brochures/pamphlets or referral lists with community programs, (2) provided internal referral for that service to one of EIP’s linkage coordinators, or (3) an external referral to a specific agency. Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.\nThere are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list. Those referral types are indicated within the table to the left as well as the figure below, and listed here: primary care (PCP), ED social work (SW), and Peer services.\nThe table to the left highlights the total number of referrals provided during the initial encounter as well as the total number of referrals provided during the linkage follow-up. These referrals do not necessarily mean that Rachael is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Rachael does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Rachael, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Rachael has been involved with is 10 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Rachael’s cases that were “eligible” were 8 eligible LTC cases (80.0% of all LTC cases, 8/10). Rachael currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/8), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Rachael has successfully closed 8 LTC cases (100.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 8/8), with a total of 2 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (25.0% of all closed LTC cases, 2/8). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    10 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    8 \n    80.0% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    8 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    2 \n    25.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously.

Rachael is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 0 thus far (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Out of those cases closed, a total of 0 were unable to be linked to care (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Rachel has conducted a total of 44 assessments, which means that 78.6% of Rachel’s encounters consisted of an assessment (44/800).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Rachel during this reporting period is 44, with 41 assessments having been screened for a SUD (93.2%, 41/44). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 16 that were positive for SUD (39.0%, 16/41).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    71.4% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    80.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    44 \n    41 \n    93.2% \n    16 \n    39.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 32 (72.7%, 32/44). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 32 (72.7%, 32/16). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 16), not all assessments (n = 44), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 1 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (3.1%, 1/32). In regards to the specific conditions that were assessed, those are provided below the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    Brief MH Assessed \n    % Brief MH Assessed \n    SUD +

scattered within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Rachel conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 40 assessments (90.9% of all those assessed, 40/44). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 38 assessments (95.0% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 38/40). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 5 assessments (13.2% of all those eligible for PrEP, 5/38).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    28.6% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    300.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    5 \n    4 \n    80.0% \n    5 \n    125.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    3 \n    1 \n    33.3% \n    2 \n    200.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    4 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    300.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    150.0% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    200.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    200.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    44 \n    40 \n    90.9% \n    38 \n    95.0% \n    5 \n    13.2% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Rachel, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Rachel has conducted (n = 26), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/26). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/5) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/21).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Rachel has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Rachel’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/26), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/5) and 0.00% for EHE (0/21).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    26 \n    5 \n    21 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Rachel has had a total of 5 tests that have resulted in a false positive (19.2% of all HIV tests, 5/26), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Rachel currently has a total of 1 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (3.8% of all HIV tests, 1/26). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up. Even if referrals are provided during the linkage process, they are represented here as any information gathered during the encounter could have led to that referral being provided.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Rachel is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Rachel does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Rachel, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Rachel has been involved with is 679 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Rachel’s cases that were “eligible” were 483 eligible LTC cases (71.1% of all LTC cases, 483/679). Rachel currently has an open case load of 19 open cases (3.9% of all eligible LTC cases, 19/483), with 1 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (5.3% of all open LTC cases, 1/19). Therefore, Rachel has successfully closed 465 LTC cases (96.3% of all eligible LTC cases, 465/483), with a total of 92 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (19.8% of all closed LTC cases, 92/465). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    679 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    483 \n    71.1% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    19 \n    3.9% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    1 \n    5.3% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    465 \n    96.3% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    92 \n    19.8% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Rachel’s HIV linkage cases.\nRachel has worked on a total of 177 HIV linkage cases (26.1% of all linkage cases, 177/679). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 23 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (13.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 23/177), and a total of 154 for those that have been previously diagnosed (87.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 154/177).\nA total of 90 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (50.8% of all HIV linkage cases, 90/177), and the reasons the remaining 87 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 23 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (25.6% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 23/90), and 67 were for those previously diagnosed (74.4% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 67/90). Rachel is currently working on 9 of these HIV linkage cases (11.1% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 81 thus far (90.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 81/90). Out of those cases closed, a total of 39 were unable to be linked to care (48.1% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 39/81), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Rachel has successfully linked a total of 42 HIV linkage cases (51.9% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 42/81). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 19 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (82.6% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 19/23), and 23 were for those that were previously diagnosed (34.3% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 23/67).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Rachel’s HCV linkage cases.\nRachel has worked on a total of 527 HCV linkage cases (77.6% of all linkage cases, 527/679). Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 152 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (28.8% of all HCV linkage cases, 152/527), and a total of 372 for those that have been previously diagnosed (70.6% of all HCV linkage cases, 372/527).\nA total of 399 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (75.7% of all HCV linkage cases, 399/527), and the reasons the remaining 128 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 120 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (30.1% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 120/399), and 279 were for those previously diagnosed (69.9% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 279/399). Rachel is currently working on 11 of these HCV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 388 thus far (97.2% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 388/399). Out of those cases closed, a total of 342 were unable to be linked to care (88.1% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 342/388), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Rachel has successfully linked a total of 46 HCV linkage cases (11.9% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 46/388). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 13 were for those newly diagnosed with HCV (10.8% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 13/120), and 33 were for those that were previously diagnosed (11.8% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 33/279).\n\n\nThe SUD Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Rachel’s SUD linkage cases.\nRachel has worked on a total of 18 SUD linkage cases (2.7% of all linkage cases, 18/679).\nA total of 9 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (50.0% of all SUD linkage cases, 9/18), and the reasons the remaining 9 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nRachel is currently working on 0 of these SUD linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 9 thus far (100.0% of all “eligible” SUD linkage cases, 9/9). Out of those cases closed, a total of 3 were unable to be linked to care (33.3% of all closed SUD linkage cases, 3/9), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Timothy has conducted a total of 78 assessments, which means that 53.4% of Timothy’s encounters consisted of an assessment (78/185).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Timothy during this reporting period is 78, with 72 assessments having been screened for a SUD (92.3%, 72/78). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 12 that were positive for SUD (16.7%, 12/72).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    02/2024 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    22 \n    20 \n    90.9% \n    7 \n    35.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    15 \n    14 \n    93.3% \n    1 \n    7.1% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    30 \n    28 \n    93.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    78 \n    72 \n    92.3% \n    12 \n    16.7% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 72 (92.3%, 72/78). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 72 (92.3%, 72/12). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 12), not all assessments (n = 78), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 13 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (18.1%, 13/72).

The total number of assessments Timothy conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 69 assessments (88.5% of all those assessed, 69/78). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 17 assessments (24.6% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 17/69). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 8 assessments (47.1% of all those eligible for PrEP, 8/17).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    02/2024 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    50.0% \n    4 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    22 \n    20 \n    90.9% \n    5 \n    25.0% \n    3 \n    60.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    15 \n    12 \n    80.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    30 \n    27 \n    90.0% \n    8 \n    29.6% \n    1 \n    12.5% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    78 \n    69 \n    88.5% \n    17 \n    24.6% \n    8 \n    47.1% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Timothy, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Timothy has conducted (n = 30), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/30). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/30) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.0% of all EHE tests, 0/0).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Timothy has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Timothy’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/30), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/30) and 0.0% for EHE (0/0).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    30 \n    30 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Timothy has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/30), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Timothy currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/30). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up. Even if referrals are provided during the linkage process, they are represented here as any information gathered during the encounter could have led to that referral being provided.

Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.\nThere are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list. Those referral types are indicated within the table to the left as well as the figure below, and listed here: primary care (PCP), ED social work (SW), and Peer services.\nThe table to the left highlights the total number of referrals provided during the initial encounter as well as the total number of referrals provided during the linkage follow-up. These referrals do not necessarily mean that Timothy is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Timothy does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Timothy, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Timothy has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Timothy’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Timothy currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Timothy has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    0 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously.
