    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Zoe has conducted a total of 134 assessments, which means that 81.2% of Zoe’s encounters consisted of an assessment (134/187).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Zoe during this reporting period is 134, with 130 assessments having been screened for a SUD (97.0%, 130/134). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 11 that were positive for SUD (8.5%, 11/130).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    08/2025 \n    22 \n    22 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    18.2% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    52 \n    50 \n    96.2% \n    3 \n    6.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    55 \n    53 \n    96.4% \n    3 \n    5.7% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    134 \n    130 \n    97.0% \n    11 \n    8.5% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 119 (88.8%, 119/134). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 119 (88.8%, 119/11). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 11), not all assessments (n = 134), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/119).

The total number of assessments Zoe conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 131 assessments (97.8% of all those assessed, 131/134). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 23 assessments (17.6% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 23/131). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 1 assessments (4.3% of all those eligible for PrEP, 1/23).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    08/2025 \n    22 \n    22 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    18.2% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    52 \n    52 \n    100.0% \n    9 \n    17.3% \n    1 \n    11.1% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    55 \n    52 \n    94.5% \n    8 \n    15.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    134 \n    131 \n    97.8% \n    23 \n    17.6% \n    1 \n    4.3% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Zoe, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Zoe has conducted (n = 84), there have been 1 positive tests (1.19% of all HIV tests, 1/84). There have been a total of 1 positive CTR tests (1.27% of all CTR tests, 1/79) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/5).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Zoe has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/1). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.00% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/1) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Zoe’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/84), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/79) and 0.00% for EHE (0/5).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    84 \n    79 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Zoe has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/84), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Zoe currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/84). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Zoe is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Zoe does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Zoe, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Zoe has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Zoe’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Zoe currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Zoe has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    0 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Zoe’s HIV linkage cases.\nZoe has worked on a total of 0 HIV linkage cases (0.0% of all linkage cases, 0/0). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 0 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and a total of 0 for those that have been previously diagnosed (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/0).\nA total of 0 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and the reasons the remaining 0 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 0 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and 0 were for those previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Zoe is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 0 thus far (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Out of those cases closed, a total of 0 were unable to be linked to care (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Tina has conducted a total of 11 assessments, which means that 84.6% of Tina’s encounters consisted of an assessment (11/25).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Tina during this reporting period is 11, with 11 assessments having been screened for a SUD (100.0%, 11/11). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 0 that were positive for SUD (0.0%, 0/11).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    10/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 10 (90.9%, 10/11). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 10 (90.9%, 10/0). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 0), not all assessments (n = 11), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/10).

The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 5 assessments (50.0% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 5/10). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Tina, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Tina has conducted (n = 4), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/4). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/4) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.0% of all EHE tests, 0/0).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Tina has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Tina’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/4), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/4) and 0.0% for EHE (0/0).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    4 \n    4 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Tina has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/4), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Tina currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/4). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up. Even if referrals are provided during the linkage process, they are represented here as any information gathered during the encounter could have led to that referral being provided.

Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.\nThere are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list. Those referral types are indicated within the table to the left as well as the figure below, and listed here: primary care (PCP), ED social work (SW), and Peer services.\nThe table to the left highlights the total number of referrals provided during the initial encounter as well as the total number of referrals provided during the linkage follow-up. These referrals do not necessarily mean that Tina is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Tina does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Tina, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Tina has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Tina’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Tina currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Tina has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    0 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously.

The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Sanaa has conducted a total of 21 assessments, which means that 72.4% of Sanaa’s encounters consisted of an assessment (21/83).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Sanaa during this reporting period is 21, with 20 assessments having been screened for a SUD (95.2%, 20/21).

Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 16 (76.2%, 16/21). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 16 (76.2%, 16/4). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 4), not all assessments (n = 21), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/16). In regards to the specific conditions that were assessed, those are provided below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    Brief MH Assessed \n    % Brief MH Assessed \n    SUD + \n    MH Assessed \n    % MH Assessed \n    MH + \n    % MH + \n  \n \n\n  \n    05/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    21 \n    16 \n    76.2% \n    4 \n    16 \n    400.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    21 \n    16 \n    76.2% \n    4 \n    16 \n    76.2% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepression: total of 15 assessed (93.8% of all those assessed for MH, 15/16), with 0 positive (0.0% of all those screened for depression, 0/15).\nAnxiety: total of 15 assessed (93.8% of all those assessed for MH, 15/16), with 0 positive (0.0% of all those screened for anxiety, 0/15).\nPTSD: total of 0 assessed (0.0% of all those assessed for MH, 0/16), with 0 positive (NA of all those screened for PTSD, 0/0).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    MH Assessed \n    Depression Assessed \n    % Depression Assessed \n    Depression positive \n    % Depression positive \n    Anxiety Assessed \n    % Anxiety Assessed \n    Anxiety positive \n    % Anxiety positive \n    PTSD Assessed \n    % PTSD Assessed \n    PTSD positive \n    % PTSD positive \n  \n \n\n  \n    05/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    16 \n    15 \n    93.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    15 \n    93.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    16 \n    15 \n    93.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    15 \n    93.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    NA \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\nPrEP eligibility is covered by several different questions scattered within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Sanaa conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 11 assessments (52.4% of all those assessed, 11/21). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 6 assessments (54.5% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 6/11). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 1 assessments (16.7% of all those eligible for PrEP, 1/6).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    05/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    21 \n    11 \n    52.4% \n    4 \n    36.4% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    21 \n    11 \n    52.4% \n    6 \n    54.5% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Sanaa, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Sanaa has conducted (n = 6), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/6). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/5) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/1).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Sanaa has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Sanaa’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/6), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/5) and 0.00% for EHE (0/1).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    6 \n    5 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Sanaa has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/6), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Sanaa currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/6). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Sanaa is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least.

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Sanaa does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Sanaa, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Sanaa has been involved with is 56 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Sanaa’s cases that were “eligible” were 30 eligible LTC cases (53.6% of all LTC cases, 30/56). Sanaa currently has an open case load of 11 open cases (36.7% of all eligible LTC cases, 11/30), with 1 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (9.1% of all open LTC cases, 1/11). Therefore, Sanaa has successfully closed 20 LTC cases (66.7% of all eligible LTC cases, 20/30), with a total of 6 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (30.0% of all closed LTC cases, 6/20). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    56 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    30 \n    53.6% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    11 \n    36.7% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    1 \n    9.1% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    20 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    6 \n    30.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Sanaa’s HIV linkage cases.\nSanaa has worked on a total of 2 HIV linkage cases (3.6% of all linkage cases, 2/56). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 0 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/2), and a total of 2 for those that have been previously diagnosed (100.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 2/2).\nA total of 0 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/2), and the reasons the remaining 2 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 0 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and 0 were for those previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Sanaa is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 0 thus far (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Out of those cases closed, a total of 0 were unable to be linked to care (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Sanaa has successfully linked a total of 0 HIV linkage cases (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 0 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 0/0), and 0 were for those that were previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 0/0).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Sanaa’s HCV linkage cases.\nSanaa has worked on a total of 6 HCV linkage cases (10.7% of all linkage cases, 6/56). Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 1 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (16.7% of all HCV linkage cases, 1/6), and a total of 5 for those that have been previously diagnosed (83.3% of all HCV linkage cases, 5/6).\nA total of 6 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (100.0% of all HCV linkage cases, 6/6), and the reasons the remaining 0 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 1 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (16.7% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 1/6), and 5 were for those previously diagnosed (83.3% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 5/6). Sanaa is currently working on 2 of these HCV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 4 thus far (66.7% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 4/6). Out of those cases closed, a total of 3 were unable to be linked to care (75.0% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 3/4), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Sanaa has successfully linked a total of 1 HCV linkage cases (25.0% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 1/4). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 0 were for those newly diagnosed with HCV (0.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 0/1), and 1 were for those that were previously diagnosed (20.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 1/5).\n\n\nThe SUD Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Sanaa’s SUD linkage cases.\nSanaa has worked on a total of 54 SUD linkage cases (96.4% of all linkage cases, 54/56).\nA total of 21 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (38.9% of all SUD linkage cases, 21/54), and the reasons the remaining 33 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nSanaa is currently working on 7 of these SUD linkage cases (14.3% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 14 thus far (66.7% of all “eligible” SUD linkage cases, 14/21). Out of those cases closed, a total of 9 were unable to be linked to care (64.3% of all closed SUD linkage cases, 9/14), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Pierre has conducted a total of 293 assessments, which means that 61.8% of Pierre’s encounters consisted of an assessment (293/785).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Pierre during this reporting period is 293, with 226 assessments having been screened for a SUD (77.1%, 226/293). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 61 that were positive for SUD (27.0%, 61/226).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    07/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    14 \n    13 \n    92.9% \n    3 \n    23.1% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    9 \n    7 \n    77.8% \n    4 \n    57.1% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    13 \n    13 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    23.1% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    10 \n    8 \n    80.0% \n    1 \n    12.5% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    10 \n    10 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    6 \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    7 \n    6 \n    85.7% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    18 \n    13 \n    72.2% \n    4 \n    30.8% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    23 \n    12 \n    52.2% \n    5 \n    41.7% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    24 \n    15 \n    62.5% \n    3 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    15 \n    9 \n    60.0% \n    1 \n    11.1% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    11 \n    7 \n    63.6% \n    1 \n    14.3% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    13 \n    12 \n    92.3% \n    3 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    4 \n    2 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    5 \n    1 \n    20.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    11 \n    6 \n    54.5% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    7 \n    5 \n    71.4% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    11 \n    5 \n    45.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    14 \n    12 \n    85.7% \n    2 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    10 \n    10 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    8 \n    6 \n    75.0% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    8 \n    6 \n    75.0% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    24 \n    24 \n    100.0% \n    9 \n    37.5% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    293 \n    226 \n    77.1% \n    61 \n    27.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 194 (66.2%, 194/293). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 194 (66.2%, 194/61). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 61), not all assessments (n = 293), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 9 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (4.6%, 9/194).

questions scattered within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Pierre conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 109 assessments (37.2% of all those assessed, 109/293). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 26 assessments (23.9% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 26/109). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 4 assessments (15.4% of all those eligible for PrEP, 4/26).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    07/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    14 \n    10 \n    71.4% \n    4 \n    40.0% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    9 \n    4 \n    44.4% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    13 \n    8 \n    61.5% \n    1 \n    12.5% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    4 \n    2 \n    50.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    10 \n    6 \n    60.0% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    10 \n    3 \n    30.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    8 \n    3 \n    37.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    6 \n    3 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    7 \n    1 \n    14.3% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    18 \n    5 \n    27.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    23 \n    3 \n    13.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    24 \n    4 \n    16.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    15 \n    3 \n    20.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    11 \n    2 \n    18.2% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    13 \n    6 \n    46.2% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    4 \n    1 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    5 \n    1 \n    20.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    11 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    7 \n    3 \n    42.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    11 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    14 \n    8 \n    57.1% \n    4 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    10 \n    4 \n    40.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    8 \n    4 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    8 \n    2 \n    25.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    24 \n    18 \n    75.0% \n    3 \n    16.7% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    2 \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    293 \n    109 \n    37.2% \n    26 \n    23.9% \n    4 \n    15.4% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Pierre, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Pierre has conducted (n = 165), there have been 1 positive tests (0.61% of all HIV tests, 1/165). There have been a total of 1 positive CTR tests (0.61% of all CTR tests, 1/163) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/2).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Pierre has identified a total of 1 new positive individuals (100.0% of all positive HIV tests, 1/1). This number is comprised of 1 new positives from CTR testing (100.00% percent of all CTR positive tests, 1/1) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Pierre’s HIV testing is 0.61% (1/165), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.61% for CTR (1/163) and 0.00% for EHE (0/2).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    165 \n    163 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.61% \n    0.61% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Pierre has had a total of 2 tests that have resulted in a false positive (1.2% of all HIV tests, 2/165), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Pierre currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/165). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Pierre is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Pierre does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Pierre, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Pierre has been involved with is 59 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Pierre’s cases that were “eligible” were 45 eligible LTC cases (76.3% of all LTC cases, 45/59). Pierre currently has an open case load of 14 open cases (31.1% of all eligible LTC cases, 14/45), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/14). Therefore, Pierre has successfully closed 32 LTC cases (71.1% of all eligible LTC cases, 32/45), with a total of 5 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (15.6% of all closed LTC cases, 5/32). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    59 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    45 \n    76.3% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    14 \n    31.1% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    32 \n    71.1% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    5 \n    15.6% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Pierre’s HIV linkage cases.\nPierre has worked on a total of 8 HIV linkage cases (13.6% of all linkage cases, 8/59). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 0 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/8), and a total of 8 for those that have been previously diagnosed (100.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 8/8).\nA total of 3 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (37.5% of all HIV linkage cases, 3/8), and the reasons the remaining 5 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 0 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/3), and 3 were for those previously diagnosed (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 3/3). Pierre is currently working on 3 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 0 thus far (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/3). Out of those cases closed, a total of 0 were unable to be linked to care (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Pierre has successfully linked a total of 0 HIV linkage cases (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 0 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 0/0), and 0 were for those that were previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 0/3).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Pierre’s HCV linkage cases.\nPierre has worked on a total of 52 HCV linkage cases (88.1% of all linkage cases, 52/59). Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 22 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (42.3% of all HCV linkage cases, 22/52), and a total of 29 for those that have been previously diagnosed (55.8% of all HCV linkage cases, 29/52).\nA total of 42 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (80.8% of all HCV linkage cases, 42/52), and the reasons the remaining 10 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 21 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (50.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 21/42), and 21 were for those previously diagnosed (50.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 21/42). Pierre is currently working on 11 of these HCV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 31 thus far (73.8% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 31/42). Out of those cases closed, a total of 27 were unable to be linked to care (87.1% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 27/31), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Pierre has successfully linked a total of 4 HCV linkage cases (12.9% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 4/31). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 1 were for those newly diagnosed with HCV (4.8% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 1/21), and 3 were for those that were previously diagnosed (14.3% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 3/21).\n\n\nThe SUD Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Pierre’s SUD linkage cases.\nPierre has worked on a total of 2 SUD linkage cases (3.4% of all linkage cases, 2/59).\nA total of 1 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (50.0% of all SUD linkage cases, 1/2), and the reasons the remaining 1 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nPierre is currently working on 0 of these SUD linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 1 thus far (100.0% of all “eligible” SUD linkage cases, 1/1). Out of those cases closed, a total of 0 were unable to be linked to care (0.0% of all closed SUD linkage cases, 0/1), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Pierre has successfully linked a total of 1 SUD linkage cases (100.0% of all closed SUD linkage cases, 1/1).\n\n\nThe Human Trafficking (HT) Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Pierre’s HT linkage cases.\nPierre has worked on a total of 0 HT linkage cases (0.0% of all linkage cases, 0/59).\nA total of 0 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (0.0% of all HT linkage cases, 0/0), and the reasons the remaining 0 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nPierre is currently working on 0 of these HT linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 0 thus far (0.0% of all “eligible” HT linkage cases, 0/0).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Noah has conducted a total of 160 assessments, which means that 77.7% of Noah’s encounters consisted of an assessment (160/860).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Noah during this reporting period is 160, with 144 assessments having been screened for a SUD (90.0%, 144/160). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 17 that were positive for SUD (11.8%, 17/144).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    14.3% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    20 \n    17 \n    85.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    13 \n    12 \n    92.3% \n    1 \n    8.3% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    8 \n    4 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    9 \n    6 \n    66.7% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    8 \n    6 \n    75.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    3 \n    1 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    9.1% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    35.3% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    11.1% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    160 \n    144 \n    90.0% \n    17 \n    11.8% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 41 (25.6%, 41/160). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 41 (25.6%, 41/17). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 17), not all assessments (n = 160), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 1 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (2.4%, 1/41).

Prophylaxis (PrEP)\nPrEP eligibility is covered by several different questions scattered within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Noah conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 151 assessments (94.4% of all those assessed, 151/160). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 73 assessments (48.3% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 73/151). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 11 assessments (15.1% of all those eligible for PrEP, 11/73).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    7 \n    6 \n    85.7% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    5 \n    4 \n    80.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    200.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    20 \n    19 \n    95.0% \n    6 \n    31.6% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    13 \n    13 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    23.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    133.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    300.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    8 \n    5 \n    62.5% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    75.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    9 \n    8 \n    88.9% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    8 \n    7 \n    87.5% \n    3 \n    42.9% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    3 \n    150.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    63.6% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    10 \n    58.8% \n    2 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    44.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    300.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    160 \n    151 \n    94.4% \n    73 \n    48.3% \n    11 \n    15.1% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Noah, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging.

There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/101) and a total of 1 positive EHE tests (2.04% of all EHE tests, 1/49).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Noah has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/1). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.00% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/1). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Noah’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/150), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/101) and 0.00% for EHE (0/49).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    150 \n    101 \n    49 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Noah has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/150), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Noah currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/150). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Noah is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "section": "Linkage to Care",
    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Noah does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Noah, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Noah has been involved with is 644 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Noah’s cases that were “eligible” were 386 eligible LTC cases (59.9% of all LTC cases, 386/644). Noah currently has an open case load of 15 open cases (3.9% of all eligible LTC cases, 15/386), with 3 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (20.0% of all open LTC cases, 3/15). Therefore, Noah has successfully closed 373 LTC cases (96.6% of all eligible LTC cases, 373/386), with a total of 159 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (42.6% of all closed LTC cases, 159/373). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    644 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    386 \n    59.9% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    15 \n    3.9% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    3 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    373 \n    96.6% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    159 \n    42.6% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Noah’s HIV linkage cases.\nNoah has worked on a total of 17 HIV linkage cases (2.6% of all linkage cases, 17/644). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 0 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/17), and a total of 16 for those that have been previously diagnosed (94.1% of all HIV linkage cases, 16/17).\nA total of 9 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (52.9% of all HIV linkage cases, 9/17), and the reasons the remaining 8 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 0 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/9), and 9 were for those previously diagnosed (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 9/9). Noah is currently working on 1 of these HIV linkage cases (100.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 8 thus far (88.9% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 8/9). Out of those cases closed, a total of 7 were unable to be linked to care (87.5% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 7/8), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Noah has successfully linked a total of 1 HIV linkage cases (12.5% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 1/8). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 0 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 0/0), and 1 were for those that were previously diagnosed (11.1% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 1/9).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Noah’s HCV linkage cases.\nNoah has worked on a total of 67 HCV linkage cases (10.4% of all linkage cases, 67/644). Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 15 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (22.4% of all HCV linkage cases, 15/67), and a total of 51 for those that have been previously diagnosed (76.1% of all HCV linkage cases, 51/67).\nA total of 53 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (79.1% of all HCV linkage cases, 53/67), and the reasons the remaining 14 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 10 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (18.9% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 10/53), and 42 were for those previously diagnosed (79.2% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 42/53). Noah is currently working on 2 of these HCV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 51 thus far (96.2% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 51/53). Out of those cases closed, a total of 39 were unable to be linked to care (76.5% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 39/51), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Maria has conducted a total of 16 assessments, which means that 80.0% of Maria’s encounters consisted of an assessment (16/38).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Maria during this reporting period is 16, with 16 assessments having been screened for a SUD (100.0%, 16/16). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 2 that were positive for SUD (12.5%, 2/16).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    09/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    18.2% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    16 \n    16 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    12.5% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 6 (37.5%, 6/16). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 6 (37.5%, 6/2). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 2), not all assessments (n = 16), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/6).

The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 6 assessments (37.5% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 6/16). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered.

There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/6) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.0% of all EHE tests, 0/0).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Maria has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Maria’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/6), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/6) and 0.0% for EHE (0/0).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    6 \n    6 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result.

Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Maria currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/6). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated.

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up. Even if referrals are provided during the linkage process, they are represented here as any information gathered during the encounter could have led to that referral being provided.

Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.\nThere are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list. Those referral types are indicated within the table to the left as well as the figure below, and listed here: primary care (PCP), ED social work (SW), and Peer services.\nThe table to the left highlights the total number of referrals provided during the initial encounter as well as the total number of referrals provided during the linkage follow-up. These referrals do not necessarily mean that Maria is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Maria does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Maria, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Maria has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Maria’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Maria currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Maria has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    0 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously.

The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Kirsten has conducted a total of 51 assessments, which means that 68.9% of Kirsten’s encounters consisted of an assessment (51/99).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Kirsten during this reporting period is 51, with 50 assessments having been screened for a SUD (98.0%, 50/51).

If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 47 (92.2%, 47/51). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 47 (92.2%, 47/3). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 3), not all assessments (n = 51), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/47). In regards to the specific conditions that were assessed, those are provided below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    Brief MH Assessed \n    % Brief MH Assessed \n    SUD + \n    MH Assessed \n    % MH Assessed \n    MH + \n    % MH + \n  \n \n\n  \n    08/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    33 \n    29 \n    87.9% \n    2 \n    29 \n    1 450.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    15 \n    15 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    15 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    3 \n    300.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    51 \n    47 \n    92.2% \n    3 \n    47 \n    92.2% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepression: total of 47 assessed (100.0% of all those assessed for MH, 47/47), with 0 positive (0.0% of all those screened for depression, 0/47).\nAnxiety: total of 47 assessed (100.0% of all those assessed for MH, 47/47), with 0 positive (0.0% of all those screened for anxiety, 0/47).\nPTSD: total of 0 assessed (0.0% of all those assessed for MH, 0/47), with 0 positive (NA of all those screened for PTSD, 0/0).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    MH Assessed \n    Depression Assessed \n    % Depression Assessed \n    Depression positive \n    % Depression positive \n    Anxiety Assessed \n    % Anxiety Assessed \n    Anxiety positive \n    % Anxiety positive \n    PTSD Assessed \n    % PTSD Assessed \n    PTSD positive \n    % PTSD positive \n  \n \n\n  \n    08/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    29 \n    29 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    29 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    15 \n    15 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    15 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    47 \n    47 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    47 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    NA \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\nPrEP eligibility is covered by several different questions scattered within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Kirsten conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 47 assessments (92.2% of all those assessed, 47/51). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 18 assessments (38.3% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 18/47). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 4 assessments (22.2% of all those eligible for PrEP, 4/18).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    08/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    3 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    33 \n    30 \n    90.9% \n    10 \n    33.3% \n    3 \n    30.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    15 \n    15 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    26.7% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    51 \n    47 \n    92.2% \n    18 \n    38.3% \n    4 \n    22.2% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Kirsten, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Kirsten has conducted (n = 33), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/33). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/29) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/4).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Kirsten has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Kirsten’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/33), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/29) and 0.00% for EHE (0/4).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    33 \n    29 \n    4 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Kirsten has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/33), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Kirsten currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/33). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Kirsten is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least.

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Kirsten does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Kirsten, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Kirsten has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Kirsten’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Kirsten currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Kirsten has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Katie has conducted a total of 522 assessments, which means that 55.9% of Katie’s encounters consisted of an assessment (522/1583).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Katie during this reporting period is 522, with 482 assessments having been screened for a SUD (92.3%, 482/522). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 150 that were positive for SUD (31.1%, 150/482).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    16 \n    16 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    6 \n    4 \n    66.7% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    11 \n    10 \n    90.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    14.3% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    10 \n    7 \n    70.0% \n    2 \n    28.6% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    37 \n    34 \n    91.9% \n    5 \n    14.7% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    15 \n    15 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    32 \n    29 \n    90.6% \n    10 \n    34.5% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    15 \n    13 \n    86.7% \n    2 \n    15.4% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    31 \n    31 \n    100.0% \n    8 \n    25.8% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    29.4% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    29 \n    28 \n    96.6% \n    16 \n    57.1% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    24 \n    24 \n    100.0% \n    11 \n    45.8% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    31 \n    30 \n    96.8% \n    15 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    35 \n    34 \n    97.1% \n    16 \n    47.1% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    16 \n    16 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    37.5% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    22 \n    19 \n    86.4% \n    12 \n    63.2% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    21 \n    21 \n    100.0% \n    10 \n    47.6% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    27 \n    26 \n    96.3% \n    9 \n    34.6% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    26 \n    22 \n    84.6% \n    5 \n    22.7% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    19 \n    17 \n    89.5% \n    4 \n    23.5% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    20 \n    19 \n    95.0% \n    4 \n    21.1% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    14 \n    9 \n    64.3% \n    2 \n    22.2% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    6 \n    5 \n    83.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    7 \n    6 \n    85.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    6 \n    5 \n    83.3% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    3 \n    1 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    2 \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    522 \n    482 \n    92.3% \n    150 \n    31.1% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 192 (36.8%, 192/522). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 193 (37.0%, 193/150). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 150), not all assessments (n = 522), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 22 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (11.4%, 22/193).

the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Katie conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 394 assessments (75.5% of all those assessed, 394/522). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 119 assessments (30.2% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 119/394). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 18 assessments (15.1% of all those eligible for PrEP, 18/119).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    16 \n    8 \n    50.0% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    6 \n    3 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    11 \n    7 \n    63.6% \n    2 \n    28.6% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    10 \n    8 \n    80.0% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    37 \n    21 \n    56.8% \n    8 \n    38.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    15 \n    6 \n    40.0% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    32 \n    22 \n    68.8% \n    4 \n    18.2% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    15 \n    12 \n    80.0% \n    4 \n    33.3% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    31 \n    23 \n    74.2% \n    8 \n    34.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    17 \n    15 \n    88.2% \n    5 \n    33.3% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    29 \n    23 \n    79.3% \n    11 \n    47.8% \n    1 \n    9.1% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    24 \n    24 \n    100.0% \n    11 \n    45.8% \n    3 \n    27.3% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    31 \n    23 \n    74.2% \n    4 \n    17.4% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    35 \n    26 \n    74.3% \n    7 \n    26.9% \n    2 \n    28.6% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    16 \n    12 \n    75.0% \n    3 \n    25.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    22 \n    19 \n    86.4% \n    9 \n    47.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    21 \n    17 \n    81.0% \n    5 \n    29.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    27 \n    20 \n    74.1% \n    2 \n    10.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    26 \n    20 \n    76.9% \n    7 \n    35.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    19 \n    16 \n    84.2% \n    3 \n    18.8% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    20 \n    15 \n    75.0% \n    1 \n    6.7% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    14 \n    10 \n    71.4% \n    1 \n    10.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    6 \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    400.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    7 \n    6 \n    85.7% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    6 \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    8 \n    7 \n    87.5% \n    4 \n    57.1% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    522 \n    394 \n    75.5% \n    119 \n    30.2% \n    18 \n    15.1% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Katie, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Katie has conducted (n = 481), there have been 4 positive tests (0.83% of all HIV tests, 4/481). There have been a total of 4 positive CTR tests (1.17% of all CTR tests, 4/342) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/139).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Katie has identified a total of 2 new positive individuals (50.0% of all positive HIV tests, 2/4). This number is comprised of 2 new positives from CTR testing (50.00% percent of all CTR positive tests, 2/4) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Katie’s HIV testing is 0.42% (2/481), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.58% for CTR (2/342) and 0.00% for EHE (0/139).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    481 \n    342 \n    139 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    4 \n    4 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    2 \n    2 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.42% \n    0.58% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Katie has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/481), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Katie currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/481). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Katie is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Katie does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Katie, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Katie has been involved with is 262 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Katie’s cases that were “eligible” were 228 eligible LTC cases (87.0% of all LTC cases, 228/262). Katie currently has an open case load of 2 open cases (0.9% of all eligible LTC cases, 2/228), with 2 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (100.0% of all open LTC cases, 2/2). Therefore, Katie has successfully closed 226 LTC cases (99.1% of all eligible LTC cases, 226/228), with a total of 53 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (23.5% of all closed LTC cases, 53/226). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    262 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    228 \n    87.0% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    2 \n    0.9% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    226 \n    99.1% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    53 \n    23.5% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Katie’s HIV linkage cases.\nKatie has worked on a total of 33 HIV linkage cases (12.6% of all linkage cases, 33/262). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 9 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (27.3% of all HIV linkage cases, 9/33), and a total of 24 for those that have been previously diagnosed (72.7% of all HIV linkage cases, 24/33).\nA total of 27 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (81.8% of all HIV linkage cases, 27/33), and the reasons the remaining 6 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 9 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (33.3% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 9/27), and 18 were for those previously diagnosed (66.7% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 18/27). Katie is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 27 thus far (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 27/27). Out of those cases closed, a total of 11 were unable to be linked to care (40.7% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 11/27), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Katie has successfully linked a total of 16 HIV linkage cases (59.3% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 16/27). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 9 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 9/9), and 7 were for those that were previously diagnosed (38.9% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 7/18).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Katie’s HCV linkage cases.\nKatie has worked on a total of 202 HCV linkage cases (77.1% of all linkage cases, 202/262). Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 85 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (42.1% of all HCV linkage cases, 85/202), and a total of 115 for those that have been previously diagnosed (56.9% of all HCV linkage cases, 115/202).\nA total of 177 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (87.6% of all HCV linkage cases, 177/202), and the reasons the remaining 25 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 78 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (44.1% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 78/177), and 97 were for those previously diagnosed (54.8% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 97/177). Katie is currently working on 2 of these HCV linkage cases (100.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 175 thus far (98.9% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 175/177). Out of those cases closed, a total of 144 were unable to be linked to care (82.3% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 144/175), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Katie has successfully linked a total of 31 HCV linkage cases (17.7% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 31/175).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Emma has conducted a total of 159 assessments, which means that 78.7% of Emma’s encounters consisted of an assessment (159/238).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Emma during this reporting period is 159, with 143 assessments having been screened for a SUD (89.9%, 143/159). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 50 that were positive for SUD (35.0%, 50/143).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    04/2025 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    22.2% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    19 \n    15 \n    78.9% \n    4 \n    26.7% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    22 \n    20 \n    90.9% \n    11 \n    55.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    26 \n    24 \n    92.3% \n    11 \n    45.8% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    32 \n    31 \n    96.9% \n    12 \n    38.7% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    33 \n    28 \n    84.8% \n    7 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    15 \n    13 \n    86.7% \n    3 \n    23.1% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    159 \n    143 \n    89.9% \n    50 \n    35.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 54 (34.0%, 54/159). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 54 (34.0%, 54/50). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 50), not all assessments (n = 159), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/54).

The total number of assessments Emma conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 122 assessments (76.7% of all those assessed, 122/159). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 47 assessments (38.5% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 47/122). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 24 assessments (51.1% of all those eligible for PrEP, 24/47).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    04/2025 \n    9 \n    7 \n    77.8% \n    3 \n    42.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    19 \n    16 \n    84.2% \n    6 \n    37.5% \n    3 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    22 \n    15 \n    68.2% \n    2 \n    13.3% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    26 \n    16 \n    61.5% \n    4 \n    25.0% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    32 \n    27 \n    84.4% \n    6 \n    22.2% \n    5 \n    83.3% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    33 \n    27 \n    81.8% \n    15 \n    55.6% \n    10 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    15 \n    11 \n    73.3% \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    36.4% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    159 \n    122 \n    76.7% \n    47 \n    38.5% \n    24 \n    51.1% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/92) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/1).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Emma has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Emma’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/93), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/92) and 0.00% for EHE (0/1).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    93 \n    92 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Emma has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/93), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Emma currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/93). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Emma is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Emma does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Emma, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Emma has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Emma’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Emma currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Emma has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Chloe has conducted a total of 367 assessments, which means that 82.3% of Chloe’s encounters consisted of an assessment (367/724).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Chloe during this reporting period is 367, with 343 assessments having been screened for a SUD (93.5%, 343/367). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 0 that were positive for SUD (0.0%, 0/343).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    16 \n    15 \n    93.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    25 \n    22 \n    88.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    23 \n    22 \n    95.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    38 \n    37 \n    97.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    14 \n    14 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    24 \n    21 \n    87.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    12 \n    9 \n    75.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    9 \n    7 \n    77.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    18 \n    17 \n    94.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    11 \n    10 \n    90.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    12 \n    11 \n    91.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    16 \n    14 \n    87.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    8 \n    7 \n    87.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    7 \n    6 \n    85.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    9 \n    8 \n    88.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    5 \n    4 \n    80.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    6 \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    2 \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    6 \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    367 \n    343 \n    93.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 0 (0.0%, 0/367). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 0 (0.0%, 0/0). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 0), not all assessments (n = 367), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (NA, 0/0).

risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Chloe conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 362 assessments (98.6% of all those assessed, 362/367). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 156 assessments (43.1% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 156/362). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 95 assessments (60.9% of all those eligible for PrEP, 95/156).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    16 \n    16 \n    100.0% \n    8 \n    50.0% \n    3 \n    37.5% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    25 \n    25 \n    100.0% \n    10 \n    40.0% \n    9 \n    90.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    23 \n    23 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    30.4% \n    3 \n    42.9% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    38 \n    37 \n    97.4% \n    14 \n    37.8% \n    10 \n    71.4% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    22.2% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    29.4% \n    4 \n    80.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    14 \n    14 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    50.0% \n    3 \n    42.9% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    24 \n    24 \n    100.0% \n    9 \n    37.5% \n    2 \n    22.2% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    12 \n    12 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    25.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    50.0% \n    3 \n    75.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    62.5% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    18 \n    17 \n    94.4% \n    14 \n    82.4% \n    7 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    45.5% \n    4 \n    80.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    87.5% \n    6 \n    85.7% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    12 \n    11 \n    91.7% \n    6 \n    54.5% \n    6 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    42.9% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    16 \n    16 \n    100.0% \n    9 \n    56.2% \n    6 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    28.6% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    27.3% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    28.6% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    57.1% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    9 \n    8 \n    88.9% \n    5 \n    62.5% \n    3 \n    60.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    50.0% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    6 \n    5 \n    83.3% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    37.5% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    6 \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    50.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    367 \n    362 \n    98.6% \n    156 \n    43.1% \n    95 \n    60.9% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Chloe, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Chloe has conducted (n = 432), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/432). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/207) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/225).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Chloe has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Chloe’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/432), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/207) and 0.00% for EHE (0/225).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    432 \n    207 \n    225 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Chloe has had a total of 1 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.2% of all HIV tests, 1/432), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Chloe currently has a total of 1 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.2% of all HIV tests, 1/432). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up.

Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.\nThere are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Chloe is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Chloe does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Chloe, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Chloe has been involved with is 273 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Chloe’s cases that were “eligible” were 203 eligible LTC cases (74.4% of all LTC cases, 203/273). Chloe currently has an open case load of 1 open cases (0.5% of all eligible LTC cases, 1/203), with 1 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (100.0% of all open LTC cases, 1/1). Therefore, Chloe has successfully closed 202 LTC cases (99.5% of all eligible LTC cases, 202/203), with a total of 66 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (32.7% of all closed LTC cases, 66/202). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    273 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    203 \n    74.4% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    1 \n    0.5% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    202 \n    99.5% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    66 \n    32.7% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Chloe’s HIV linkage cases.\nChloe has worked on a total of 67 HIV linkage cases (24.5% of all linkage cases, 67/273). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 7 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (10.4% of all HIV linkage cases, 7/67), and a total of 60 for those that have been previously diagnosed (89.6% of all HIV linkage cases, 60/67).\nA total of 41 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (61.2% of all HIV linkage cases, 41/67), and the reasons the remaining 26 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 7 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (17.1% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 7/41), and 34 were for those previously diagnosed (82.9% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 34/41). Chloe is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 41 thus far (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 41/41). Out of those cases closed, a total of 22 were unable to be linked to care (53.7% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 22/41), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Chloe has successfully linked a total of 19 HIV linkage cases (46.3% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 19/41). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 7 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 7/7), and 12 were for those that were previously diagnosed (35.3% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 12/34).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Chloe’s HCV linkage cases.\nChloe has worked on a total of 154 HCV linkage cases (56.4% of all linkage cases, 154/273). Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 27 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (17.5% of all HCV linkage cases, 27/154), and a total of 114 for those that have been previously diagnosed (74.0% of all HCV linkage cases, 114/154).\nA total of 119 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (77.3% of all HCV linkage cases, 119/154), and the reasons the remaining 35 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 19 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (16.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 19/119), and 89 were for those previously diagnosed (74.8% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 89/119). Chloe is currently working on 0 of these HCV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 119 thus far (100.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 119/119). Out of those cases closed, a total of 86 were unable to be linked to care (72.3% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 86/119), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Claudia has conducted a total of 40 assessments, which means that 83.3% of Claudia’s encounters consisted of an assessment (40/63).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Claudia during this reporting period is 40, with 37 assessments having been screened for a SUD (92.5%, 37/40). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 9 that were positive for SUD (24.3%, 9/37).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    10/2025 \n    18 \n    15 \n    83.3% \n    3 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    22 \n    22 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    27.3% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    40 \n    37 \n    92.5% \n    9 \n    24.3% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 29 (72.5%, 29/40). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 29 (72.5%, 29/9). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 9), not all assessments (n = 40), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/29).

The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 14 assessments (43.8% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 14/32). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered.

This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Claudia’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/10), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/10) and 0.0% for EHE (0/0).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    10 \n    10 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result.

Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Claudia currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/10). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

    "text": "Referrals\nReferral information can be provided to patients/clients regardless of what occurs during their encounter, and regardless of whether or not they received any EIP services during their encounter. They may be provided based on brief conversations with our staff or from information gathered from medical staff that may not have been documented within the EIP database. Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up. Even if referrals are provided during the linkage process, they are represented here as any information gathered during the encounter could have led to that referral being provided. The referrals will be noted separately, but also as a combined total, and the referrals provided specifically during the linkage process will be repeated in the linkage to care section.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Encounter referral \n    Linkage referral \n  \n \n\n  \n    HIV \n    50 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    Hepatitis C \n    52 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    SUD \n    52 \n    3 \n  \n  \n    Human Trafficking \n    53 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Mental Health \n    53 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    Housing \n    53 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    PrEP \n    53 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    STI \n    52 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Food services \n    53 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Financial assistance \n    53 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Person abuse \n    53 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    General health \n    53 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    PCP* \n    18 \n     \n  \n  \n    ED SW* \n    1 \n     \n  \n  \n    Peer services* \n    3 \n     \n  \n  \n    Other \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    653 \n    5 \n  \n\n\n* No linkage referral documentation\n\n\n\n\n\nReferrals are documented in the EIP database in three different ways at the encounter level: (1) provided information, such as brochures/pamphlets or referral lists with community programs, (2) provided internal referral for that service to one of EIP’s linkage coordinators, or (3) an external referral to a specific agency. Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.\nThere are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list. Those referral types are indicated within the table to the left as well as the figure below, and listed here: primary care (PCP), ED social work (SW), and Peer services.\nThe table to the left highlights the total number of referrals provided during the initial encounter as well as the total number of referrals provided during the linkage follow-up. These referrals do not necessarily mean that Claudia is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Claudia does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Claudia, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Claudia has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Claudia’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Claudia currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Claudia has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    0 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Brooke has conducted a total of 412 assessments, which means that 60.4% of Brooke’s encounters consisted of an assessment (412/858).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Brooke during this reporting period is 412, with 340 assessments having been screened for a SUD (82.5%, 340/412). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 85 that were positive for SUD (25.0%, 85/340).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    03/2024 \n    9 \n    6 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    17 \n    11 \n    64.7% \n    1 \n    9.1% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    13 \n    7 \n    53.8% \n    1 \n    14.3% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    32 \n    25 \n    78.1% \n    8 \n    32.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    34 \n    29 \n    85.3% \n    11 \n    37.9% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    22 \n    16 \n    72.7% \n    7 \n    43.8% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    35.3% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    18 \n    15 \n    83.3% \n    7 \n    46.7% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    17 \n    14 \n    82.4% \n    3 \n    21.4% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    30 \n    23 \n    76.7% \n    2 \n    8.7% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    11 \n    9 \n    81.8% \n    3 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    11 \n    9 \n    81.8% \n    4 \n    44.4% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    21 \n    16 \n    76.2% \n    2 \n    12.5% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    11 \n    10 \n    90.9% \n    1 \n    10.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    33 \n    30 \n    90.9% \n    7 \n    23.3% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    18 \n    13 \n    72.2% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    33 \n    27 \n    81.8% \n    6 \n    22.2% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    32 \n    32 \n    100.0% \n    9 \n    28.1% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    23 \n    21 \n    91.3% \n    2 \n    9.5% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    412 \n    340 \n    82.5% \n    85 \n    25.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 151 (36.7%, 151/412). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 152 (36.9%, 152/85). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 85), not all assessments (n = 412), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 9 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (5.9%, 9/152).

by several different questions scattered within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Brooke conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 167 assessments (40.5% of all those assessed, 167/412). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 48 assessments (28.7% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 48/167). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 7 assessments (14.6% of all those eligible for PrEP, 7/48).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    03/2024 \n    9 \n    2 \n    22.2% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    17 \n    2 \n    11.8% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    13 \n    4 \n    30.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    32 \n    1 \n    3.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    34 \n    16 \n    47.1% \n    3 \n    18.8% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    22 \n    7 \n    31.8% \n    3 \n    42.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    17 \n    5 \n    29.4% \n    3 \n    60.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    18 \n    5 \n    27.8% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    17 \n    6 \n    35.3% \n    3 \n    50.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    30 \n    8 \n    26.7% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    11 \n    5 \n    45.5% \n    3 \n    60.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    11 \n    5 \n    45.5% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    21 \n    12 \n    57.1% \n    3 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    11 \n    6 \n    54.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    33 \n    18 \n    54.5% \n    2 \n    11.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    18 \n    6 \n    33.3% \n    3 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    33 \n    14 \n    42.4% \n    5 \n    35.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    32 \n    26 \n    81.2% \n    6 \n    23.1% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    8 \n    4 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    23 \n    13 \n    56.5% \n    9 \n    69.2% \n    2 \n    22.2% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    412 \n    167 \n    40.5% \n    48 \n    28.7% \n    7 \n    14.6% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/211) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/4).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Brooke has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Brooke’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/215), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/211) and 0.00% for EHE (0/4).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    215 \n    211 \n    4 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Brooke has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/215), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Brooke currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/215). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Brooke is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least.

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Brooke does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Brooke, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Brooke has been involved with is 67 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Brooke’s cases that were “eligible” were 62 eligible LTC cases (92.5% of all LTC cases, 62/67). Brooke currently has an open case load of 13 open cases (21.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 13/62), with 1 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (7.7% of all open LTC cases, 1/13). Therefore, Brooke has successfully closed 50 LTC cases (80.6% of all eligible LTC cases, 50/62), with a total of 10 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (20.0% of all closed LTC cases, 10/50). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    67 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    62 \n    92.5% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    13 \n    21.0% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    1 \n    7.7% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    50 \n    80.6% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    10 \n    20.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Brooke’s HIV linkage cases.\nBrooke has worked on a total of 13 HIV linkage cases (19.4% of all linkage cases, 13/67). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 1 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (7.7% of all HIV linkage cases, 1/13), and a total of 11 for those that have been previously diagnosed (84.6% of all HIV linkage cases, 11/13).\nA total of 12 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (92.3% of all HIV linkage cases, 12/13), and the reasons the remaining 1 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 1 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (8.3% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 1/12), and 10 were for those previously diagnosed (83.3% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 10/12). Brooke is currently working on 7 of these HIV linkage cases (14.3% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 5 thus far (41.7% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 5/12). Out of those cases closed, a total of 3 were unable to be linked to care (60.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 3/5), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Brooke has successfully linked a total of 2 HIV linkage cases (40.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 2/5). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 1 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 1/1), and 1 were for those that were previously diagnosed (10.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 1/10).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Brooke’s HCV linkage cases.\nBrooke has worked on a total of 53 HCV linkage cases (79.1% of all linkage cases, 53/67). Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 31 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (58.5% of all HCV linkage cases, 31/53), and a total of 22 for those that have been previously diagnosed (41.5% of all HCV linkage cases, 22/53).\nA total of 49 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (92.5% of all HCV linkage cases, 49/53), and the reasons the remaining 4 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 31 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (63.3% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 31/49), and 18 were for those previously diagnosed (36.7% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 18/49). Brooke is currently working on 6 of these HCV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 43 thus far (87.8% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 43/49). Out of those cases closed, a total of 36 were unable to be linked to care (83.7% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 36/43), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Brooke has successfully linked a total of 7 HCV linkage cases (16.3% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 7/43). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 5 were for those newly diagnosed with HCV (16.1% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 5/31), and 2 were for those that were previously diagnosed (11.1% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 2/18).\n\n\nThe SUD Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Brooke’s SUD linkage cases.\nBrooke has worked on a total of 2 SUD linkage cases (3.0% of all linkage cases, 2/67).\nA total of 2 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (100.0% of all SUD linkage cases, 2/2), and the reasons the remaining 0 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nBrooke is currently working on 0 of these SUD linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 2 thus far (100.0% of all “eligible” SUD linkage cases, 2/2). Out of those cases closed, a total of 1 were unable to be linked to care (50.0% of all closed SUD linkage cases, 1/2), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Angela has conducted a total of 84 assessments, which means that 82.4% of Angela’s encounters consisted of an assessment (84/156).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Angela during this reporting period is 84, with 84 assessments having been screened for a SUD (100.0%, 84/84). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 34 that were positive for SUD (40.5%, 34/84).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    07/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    8 \n    72.7% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    12 \n    12 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    41.7% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    44 \n    44 \n    100.0% \n    16 \n    36.4% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    29.4% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    84 \n    84 \n    100.0% \n    34 \n    40.5% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 15 (17.9%, 15/84). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 15 (17.9%, 15/34). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 34), not all assessments (n = 84), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/15).

The total number of assessments Angela conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 84 assessments (100.0% of all those assessed, 84/84). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 36 assessments (42.9% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 36/84). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 5 assessments (13.9% of all those eligible for PrEP, 5/36).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    07/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    5 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    54.5% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    12 \n    12 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    50.0% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    44 \n    44 \n    100.0% \n    14 \n    31.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    29.4% \n    3 \n    60.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    84 \n    84 \n    100.0% \n    36 \n    42.9% \n    5 \n    13.9% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Angela currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/35). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

The referrals will be noted separately, but also as a combined total, and the referrals provided specifically during the linkage process will be repeated in the linkage to care section.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Encounter referral \n    Linkage referral \n  \n \n\n  \n    HIV \n    47 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    Hepatitis C \n    134 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    SUD \n    135 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    Human Trafficking \n    135 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Mental Health \n    107 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    Housing \n    135 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    PrEP \n    99 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    STI \n    135 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Food services \n    135 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Financial assistance \n    135 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Person abuse \n    135 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    General health \n    135 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    PCP* \n    54 \n     \n  \n  \n    ED SW* \n    1 \n     \n  \n  \n    Peer services* \n    0 \n     \n  \n  \n    Other \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    1523 \n    6 \n  \n\n\n* No linkage referral documentation\n\n\n\n\n\nReferrals are documented in the EIP database in three different ways at the encounter level: (1) provided information, such as brochures/pamphlets or referral lists with community programs, (2) provided internal referral for that service to one of EIP’s linkage coordinators, or (3) an external referral to a specific agency. Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.\nThere are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list. Those referral types are indicated within the table to the left as well as the figure below, and listed here: primary care (PCP), ED social work (SW), and Peer services.\nThe table to the left highlights the total number of referrals provided during the initial encounter as well as the total number of referrals provided during the linkage follow-up. These referrals do not necessarily mean that Angela is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Angela does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Angela, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Angela has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Angela’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Angela currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Angela has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    0 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously.

Angela is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 0 thus far (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Out of those cases closed, a total of 0 were unable to be linked to care (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Ashley has conducted a total of 2 assessments, which means that 100.0% of Ashley’s encounters consisted of an assessment (2/16).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Ashley during this reporting period is 2, with 2 assessments having been screened for a SUD (100.0%, 2/2). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 0 that were positive for SUD (0.0%, 0/2).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    10/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 1 (50.0%, 1/2).

Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 0), not all assessments (n = 2), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/1).

The total number of assessments Ashley conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 2 assessments (100.0% of all those assessed, 2/2). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 2 assessments (100.0% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 2/2). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered.

This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0).

Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Ashley currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (NA of all HIV tests, 0/0). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Ashley is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least.

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Ashley does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Ashley, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Ashley has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Ashley’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Ashley currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Ashley has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Brooke has conducted a total of 345 assessments, which means that 89.8% of Brooke’s encounters consisted of an assessment (345/420).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Brooke during this reporting period is 345, with 290 assessments having been screened for a SUD (84.1%, 290/345). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 62 that were positive for SUD (21.4%, 62/290).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    11/2024 \n    15 \n    10 \n    66.7% \n    7 \n    70.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    19 \n    18 \n    94.7% \n    10 \n    55.6% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    23 \n    18 \n    78.3% \n    2 \n    11.1% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    18 \n    13 \n    72.2% \n    1 \n    7.7% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    26 \n    23 \n    88.5% \n    3 \n    13.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    33 \n    29 \n    87.9% \n    2 \n    6.9% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    27 \n    24 \n    88.9% \n    2 \n    8.3% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    36 \n    30 \n    83.3% \n    7 \n    23.3% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    49 \n    40 \n    81.6% \n    8 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    23 \n    22 \n    95.7% \n    7 \n    31.8% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    32 \n    23 \n    71.9% \n    6 \n    26.1% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    36 \n    32 \n    88.9% \n    6 \n    18.8% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    12.5% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    345 \n    290 \n    84.1% \n    62 \n    21.4% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 262 (75.9%, 262/345). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 262 (75.9%, 262/62). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 62), not all assessments (n = 345), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 12 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (4.6%, 12/262).

The total number of assessments Brooke conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 268 assessments (77.7% of all those assessed, 268/345). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 51 assessments (19.0% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 51/268). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 9 assessments (17.6% of all those eligible for PrEP, 9/51).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    11/2024 \n    15 \n    6 \n    40.0% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    19 \n    15 \n    78.9% \n    3 \n    20.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    23 \n    17 \n    73.9% \n    5 \n    29.4% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    18 \n    14 \n    77.8% \n    2 \n    14.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    26 \n    22 \n    84.6% \n    3 \n    13.6% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    33 \n    28 \n    84.8% \n    8 \n    28.6% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    27 \n    24 \n    88.9% \n    4 \n    16.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    36 \n    25 \n    69.4% \n    6 \n    24.0% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    49 \n    38 \n    77.6% \n    6 \n    15.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    23 \n    19 \n    82.6% \n    6 \n    31.6% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    32 \n    22 \n    68.8% \n    2 \n    9.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    36 \n    30 \n    83.3% \n    4 \n    13.3% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    12.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    345 \n    268 \n    77.7% \n    51 \n    19.0% \n    9 \n    17.6% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Brooke, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging.

There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/140) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/1).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Brooke has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Brooke’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/141), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/140) and 0.00% for EHE (0/1).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    141 \n    140 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Brooke has had a total of 1 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.7% of all HIV tests, 1/141), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Brooke currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/141). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Brooke is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Brooke does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Brooke, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Brooke has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Brooke’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Brooke currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Brooke has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Connor has conducted a total of 231 assessments, which means that 83.4% of Connor’s encounters consisted of an assessment (231/414).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Connor during this reporting period is 231, with 222 assessments having been screened for a SUD (96.1%, 222/231).

If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 180 (77.9%, 180/231). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 180 (77.9%, 180/52). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 52), not all assessments (n = 231), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 2 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (1.1%, 2/180).

The total number of assessments Connor conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 164 assessments (71.0% of all those assessed, 164/231). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 40 assessments (24.4% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 40/164). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 3 assessments (7.5% of all those eligible for PrEP, 3/40).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    11/2024 \n    19 \n    16 \n    84.2% \n    2 \n    12.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    10 \n    8 \n    80.0% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    8 \n    4 \n    50.0% \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    7 \n    5 \n    71.4% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    10 \n    9 \n    90.0% \n    1 \n    11.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    18 \n    13 \n    72.2% \n    6 \n    46.2% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    42 \n    32 \n    76.2% \n    1 \n    3.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    42 \n    20 \n    47.6% \n    6 \n    30.0% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    37 \n    25 \n    67.6% \n    5 \n    20.0% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    19 \n    17 \n    89.5% \n    1 \n    5.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    8 \n    6 \n    75.0% \n    3 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    10 \n    8 \n    80.0% \n    6 \n    75.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    200.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    231 \n    164 \n    71.0% \n    40 \n    24.4% \n    3 \n    7.5% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Connor, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Connor has conducted (n = 133), there have been 2 positive tests (1.50% of all HIV tests, 2/133). There have been a total of 2 positive CTR tests (1.68% of all CTR tests, 2/119) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/14).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Connor has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/2). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.00% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/2) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Connor’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/133), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/119) and 0.00% for EHE (0/14).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    133 \n    119 \n    14 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    2 \n    2 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Connor has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/133), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Connor currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/133). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Connor is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Connor does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Connor, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Connor has been involved with is 118 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Connor’s cases that were “eligible” were 93 eligible LTC cases (78.8% of all LTC cases, 93/118). Connor currently has an open case load of 18 open cases (19.4% of all eligible LTC cases, 18/93), with 1 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (5.6% of all open LTC cases, 1/18). Therefore, Connor has successfully closed 75 LTC cases (80.6% of all eligible LTC cases, 75/93), with a total of 18 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (24.0% of all closed LTC cases, 18/75). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    118 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    93 \n    78.8% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    18 \n    19.4% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    1 \n    5.6% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    75 \n    80.6% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    18 \n    24.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Connor’s HIV linkage cases.\nConnor has worked on a total of 26 HIV linkage cases (22.0% of all linkage cases, 26/118). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 5 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (19.2% of all HIV linkage cases, 5/26), and a total of 20 for those that have been previously diagnosed (76.9% of all HIV linkage cases, 20/26).\nA total of 18 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (69.2% of all HIV linkage cases, 18/26), and the reasons the remaining 8 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 5 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (27.8% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 5/18), and 13 were for those previously diagnosed (72.2% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 13/18). Connor is currently working on 9 of these HIV linkage cases (11.1% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 9 thus far (50.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 9/18). Out of those cases closed, a total of 4 were unable to be linked to care (44.4% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 4/9), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Connor has successfully linked a total of 5 HIV linkage cases (55.6% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 5/9). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 2 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (40.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 2/5), and 3 were for those that were previously diagnosed (23.1% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 3/13).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously.

These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Connor has successfully linked a total of 10 HCV linkage cases (15.6% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 10/64). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 3 were for those newly diagnosed with HCV (14.3% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 3/21), and 7 were for those that were previously diagnosed (13.2% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 7/53).\n\n\nThe SUD Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Connor’s SUD linkage cases.\nConnor has worked on a total of 8 SUD linkage cases (6.8% of all linkage cases, 8/118).\nA total of 5 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (62.5% of all SUD linkage cases, 5/8), and the reasons the remaining 3 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nConnor is currently working on 0 of these SUD linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 5 thus far (100.0% of all “eligible” SUD linkage cases, 5/5).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Deacon has conducted a total of 6 assessments, which means that 75.0% of Deacon’s encounters consisted of an assessment (6/29).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Deacon during this reporting period is 6, with 6 assessments having been screened for a SUD (100.0%, 6/6). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 0 that were positive for SUD (0.0%, 0/6).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    10/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    6 \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 1 (16.7%, 1/6). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 1 (16.7%, 1/0). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 0), not all assessments (n = 6), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/1).

The total number of assessments Deacon conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 6 assessments (100.0% of all those assessed, 6/6). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 4 assessments (66.7% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 4/6). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered.

Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Deacon currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/8). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated.

This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least.

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Deacon does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Deacon, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Deacon has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Deacon’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Deacon currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Deacon has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0).

The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Deacon’s HIV linkage cases.\nDeacon has worked on a total of 0 HIV linkage cases (0.0% of all linkage cases, 0/0). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 0 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and a total of 0 for those that have been previously diagnosed (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/0).\nA total of 0 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and the reasons the remaining 0 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 0 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and 0 were for those previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Deacon is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 0 thus far (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Kathy has conducted a total of 20 assessments, which means that 71.4% of Kathy’s encounters consisted of an assessment (20/657).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Kathy during this reporting period is 20, with 17 assessments having been screened for a SUD (85.0%, 17/20).

If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 9 (45.0%, 9/20). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 9 (45.0%, 9/8). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 8), not all assessments (n = 20), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 1 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (11.1%, 1/9). In regards to the specific conditions that were assessed, those are provided below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    Brief MH Assessed \n    % Brief MH Assessed \n    SUD +

within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Kathy conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 12 assessments (60.0% of all those assessed, 12/20). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 49 assessments (408.3% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 49/12). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 4 assessments (8.2% of all those eligible for PrEP, 4/49).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    06/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    600.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    300.0% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    6 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    4 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    300.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    6 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    150.0% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    20 \n    12 \n    60.0% \n    49 \n    408.3% \n    4 \n    8.2% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Kathy, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Kathy has conducted (n = 22), there have been 1 positive tests (4.55% of all HIV tests, 1/22). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/17) and a total of 1 positive EHE tests (20.00% of all EHE tests, 1/5).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Kathy has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/1). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.00% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/1). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Kathy’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/22), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/17) and 0.00% for EHE (0/5).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    22 \n    17 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Kathy has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/22), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Kathy currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/22). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Kathy is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Kathy does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Kathy, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Kathy has been involved with is 373 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Kathy’s cases that were “eligible” were 264 eligible LTC cases (70.8% of all LTC cases, 264/373). Kathy currently has an open case load of 17 open cases (6.4% of all eligible LTC cases, 17/264), with 1 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (5.9% of all open LTC cases, 1/17). Therefore, Kathy has successfully closed 249 LTC cases (94.3% of all eligible LTC cases, 249/264), with a total of 126 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (50.6% of all closed LTC cases, 126/249). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    373 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    264 \n    70.8% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    17 \n    6.4% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    1 \n    5.9% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    249 \n    94.3% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    126 \n    50.6% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Kathy’s HIV linkage cases.\nKathy has worked on a total of 10 HIV linkage cases (2.7% of all linkage cases, 10/373). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 0 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/10), and a total of 9 for those that have been previously diagnosed (90.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 9/10).\nA total of 7 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (70.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 7/10), and the reasons the remaining 3 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 0 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/7), and 7 were for those previously diagnosed (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 7/7). Kathy is currently working on 2 of these HIV linkage cases (50.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 5 thus far (71.4% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 5/7). Out of those cases closed, a total of 5 were unable to be linked to care (100.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 5/5), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Kathy has successfully linked a total of 0 HIV linkage cases (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/5). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 0 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 0/0), and 0 were for those that were previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 0/7).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Kathy’s HCV linkage cases.\nKathy has worked on a total of 32 HCV linkage cases (8.6% of all linkage cases, 32/373). Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 9 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (28.1% of all HCV linkage cases, 9/32), and a total of 22 for those that have been previously diagnosed (68.8% of all HCV linkage cases, 22/32).\nA total of 25 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (78.1% of all HCV linkage cases, 25/32), and the reasons the remaining 7 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 5 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (20.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 5/25), and 19 were for those previously diagnosed (76.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 19/25). Kathy is currently working on 1 of these HCV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 24 thus far (96.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 24/25). Out of those cases closed, a total of 20 were unable to be linked to care (83.3% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 20/24), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Kathy has successfully linked a total of 4 HCV linkage cases (16.7% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 4/24). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 0 were for those newly diagnosed with HCV (0.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 0/5), and 4 were for those that were previously diagnosed (21.1% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 4/19).\n\n\nThe SUD Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Kathy’s SUD linkage cases.\nKathy has worked on a total of 351 SUD linkage cases (94.1% of all linkage cases, 351/373).\nA total of 235 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (67.0% of all SUD linkage cases, 235/351), and the reasons the remaining 116 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nKathy is currently working on 6 of these SUD linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 229 thus far (97.4% of all “eligible” SUD linkage cases, 229/235). Out of those cases closed, a total of 115 were unable to be linked to care (50.2% of all closed SUD linkage cases, 115/229), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Nico has conducted a total of 379 assessments, which means that 93.3% of Nico’s encounters consisted of an assessment (379/415).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Nico during this reporting period is 379, with 365 assessments having been screened for a SUD (96.3%, 365/379). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 56 that were positive for SUD (15.3%, 56/365).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    04/2025 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    53 \n    49 \n    92.5% \n    6 \n    12.2% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    58 \n    53 \n    91.4% \n    6 \n    11.3% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    77 \n    76 \n    98.7% \n    15 \n    19.7% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    57 \n    56 \n    98.2% \n    17 \n    30.4% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    52 \n    50 \n    96.2% \n    8 \n    16.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    57 \n    56 \n    98.2% \n    4 \n    7.1% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    14 \n    14 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    379 \n    365 \n    96.3% \n    56 \n    15.3% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 285 (75.2%, 285/379). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 285 (75.2%, 285/56). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 56), not all assessments (n = 379), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/285).

Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 0 assessments (0.0% of all those eligible for PrEP, 0/29).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    04/2025 \n    11 \n    7 \n    63.6% \n    1 \n    14.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    53 \n    43 \n    81.1% \n    2 \n    4.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    58 \n    51 \n    87.9% \n    2 \n    3.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    77 \n    74 \n    96.1% \n    7 \n    9.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    57 \n    53 \n    93.0% \n    6 \n    11.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    52 \n    50 \n    96.2% \n    6 \n    12.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    57 \n    56 \n    98.2% \n    5 \n    8.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    14 \n    14 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    379 \n    348 \n    91.8% \n    29 \n    8.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Nico’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/207), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/206) and 0.00% for EHE (0/1).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    207 \n    206 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result.

Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Nico currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/207). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Nico is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Nico does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Nico, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Nico has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Nico’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Nico currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Nico has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Rachel has conducted a total of 66 assessments, which means that 83.5% of Rachel’s encounters consisted of an assessment (66/1410).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Rachel during this reporting period is 66, with 62 assessments having been screened for a SUD (93.9%, 62/66). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 16 that were positive for SUD (25.8%, 16/62).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    71.4% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    80.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    6 \n    5 \n    83.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    66 \n    62 \n    93.9% \n    16 \n    25.8% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 33 (50.0%, 33/66). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 33 (50.0%, 33/16). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 16), not all assessments (n = 66), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 1 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (3.0%, 1/33).

several different questions scattered within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Rachel conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 61 assessments (92.4% of all those assessed, 61/66). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 60 assessments (98.4% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 60/61). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 17 assessments (28.3% of all those eligible for PrEP, 17/60).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2023 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    28.6% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2023 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2023 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    300.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    05/2023 \n    5 \n    4 \n    80.0% \n    5 \n    125.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2023 \n    3 \n    1 \n    33.3% \n    2 \n    200.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2023 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    4 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    300.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2023 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2023 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    150.0% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    12/2023 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    200.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    200.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    200.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    6 \n    5 \n    83.3% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    150.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    66 \n    61 \n    92.4% \n    60 \n    98.4% \n    17 \n    28.3% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Rachel, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Rachel has conducted (n = 50), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/50). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/14) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/36).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Rachel has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Rachel’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/50), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/14) and 0.00% for EHE (0/36).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    50 \n    14 \n    36 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Rachel has had a total of 8 tests that have resulted in a false positive (16.0% of all HIV tests, 8/50), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Rachel currently has a total of 1 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (2.0% of all HIV tests, 1/50). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Rachel is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Rachel does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Rachel, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Rachel has been involved with is 1200 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Rachel’s cases that were “eligible” were 867 eligible LTC cases (72.2% of all LTC cases, 867/1200). Rachel currently has an open case load of 7 open cases (0.8% of all eligible LTC cases, 7/867), with 2 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (28.6% of all open LTC cases, 2/7). Therefore, Rachel has successfully closed 861 LTC cases (99.3% of all eligible LTC cases, 861/867), with a total of 177 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (20.6% of all closed LTC cases, 177/861). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    1200 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    867 \n    72.2% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    7 \n    0.8% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    2 \n    28.6% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    861 \n    99.3% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    177 \n    20.6% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Rachel’s HIV linkage cases.\nRachel has worked on a total of 306 HIV linkage cases (25.5% of all linkage cases, 306/1200). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 29 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (9.5% of all HIV linkage cases, 29/306), and a total of 275 for those that have been previously diagnosed (89.9% of all HIV linkage cases, 275/306).\nA total of 143 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (46.7% of all HIV linkage cases, 143/306), and the reasons the remaining 163 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 28 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (19.6% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 28/143), and 114 were for those previously diagnosed (79.7% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 114/143). Rachel is currently working on 5 of these HIV linkage cases (40.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 138 thus far (96.5% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 138/143). Out of those cases closed, a total of 80 were unable to be linked to care (58.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 80/138), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Rachel has successfully linked a total of 58 HIV linkage cases (42.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 58/138). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 25 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (89.3% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 25/28), and 33 were for those that were previously diagnosed (28.9% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 33/114).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Rachel’s HCV linkage cases.\nRachel has worked on a total of 930 HCV linkage cases (77.5% of all linkage cases, 930/1200). Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 309 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (33.2% of all HCV linkage cases, 309/930), and a total of 613 for those that have been previously diagnosed (65.9% of all HCV linkage cases, 613/930).\nA total of 733 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (78.8% of all HCV linkage cases, 733/930), and the reasons the remaining 197 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 256 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (34.9% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 256/733), and 472 were for those previously diagnosed (64.4% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 472/733). Rachel is currently working on 1 of these HCV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 732 thus far (99.9% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 732/733). Out of those cases closed, a total of 619 were unable to be linked to care (84.6% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 619/732), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Skylar has conducted a total of 83 assessments, which means that 78.3% of Skylar’s encounters consisted of an assessment (83/126).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Skylar during this reporting period is 83, with 80 assessments having been screened for a SUD (96.4%, 80/83). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 9 that were positive for SUD (11.2%, 9/80).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    08/2025 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    12.5% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    31 \n    30 \n    96.8% \n    2 \n    6.7% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    27 \n    25 \n    92.6% \n    1 \n    4.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    29.4% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    83 \n    80 \n    96.4% \n    9 \n    11.2% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 73 (88.0%, 73/83). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 73 (88.0%, 73/9). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 9), not all assessments (n = 83), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/73).

The total number of assessments Skylar conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 78 assessments (94.0% of all those assessed, 78/83). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 17 assessments (21.8% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 17/78). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 3 assessments (17.6% of all those eligible for PrEP, 3/17).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    08/2025 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    31 \n    26 \n    83.9% \n    4 \n    15.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    27 \n    27 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    22.2% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    29.4% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    83 \n    78 \n    94.0% \n    17 \n    21.8% \n    3 \n    17.6% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Skylar’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/46), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/46) and 0.0% for EHE (0/0).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    46 \n    46 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Skylar has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/46), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Skylar currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/46). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Skylar is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least.

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Skylar does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Skylar, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Skylar has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Skylar’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Skylar currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Skylar has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below.

There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Timothy during this reporting period is 416, with 385 assessments having been screened for a SUD (92.5%, 385/416). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 26 that were positive for SUD (6.8%, 26/385).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    02/2024 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    22 \n    20 \n    90.9% \n    7 \n    35.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    15 \n    14 \n    93.3% \n    1 \n    7.1% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    30 \n    28 \n    93.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    27 \n    24 \n    88.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    32 \n    32 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    30 \n    29 \n    96.7% \n    1 \n    3.4% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    32 \n    32 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    18 \n    18 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    5.6% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    17 \n    16 \n    94.1% \n    1 \n    6.2% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    21 \n    21 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    28 \n    26 \n    92.9% \n    3 \n    11.5% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    15 \n    13 \n    86.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    25 \n    23 \n    92.0% \n    2 \n    8.7% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    15 \n    15 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    26 \n    22 \n    84.6% \n    2 \n    9.1% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    15 \n    12 \n    80.0% \n    1 \n    8.3% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    14 \n    13 \n    92.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    19 \n    14 \n    73.7% \n    2 \n    14.3% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    416 \n    385 \n    92.5% \n    26 \n    6.8% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 354 (85.1%, 354/416). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 354 (85.1%, 354/26). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 26), not all assessments (n = 416), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 15 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (4.2%, 15/354).

be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Timothy conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 342 assessments (82.2% of all those assessed, 342/416). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 94 assessments (27.5% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 94/342). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 14 assessments (14.9% of all those eligible for PrEP, 14/94).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    02/2024 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    62.5% \n    4 \n    80.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    22 \n    20 \n    90.9% \n    5 \n    25.0% \n    3 \n    60.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    15 \n    12 \n    80.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    30 \n    27 \n    90.0% \n    8 \n    29.6% \n    1 \n    12.5% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    27 \n    22 \n    81.5% \n    2 \n    9.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    32 \n    29 \n    90.6% \n    5 \n    17.2% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    30 \n    25 \n    83.3% \n    3 \n    12.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    32 \n    27 \n    84.4% \n    4 \n    14.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    18 \n    16 \n    88.9% \n    4 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    17 \n    16 \n    94.1% \n    4 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    21 \n    18 \n    85.7% \n    7 \n    38.9% \n    1 \n    14.3% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    28 \n    25 \n    89.3% \n    10 \n    40.0% \n    1 \n    10.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    15 \n    12 \n    80.0% \n    7 \n    58.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    25 \n    19 \n    76.0% \n    4 \n    21.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    15 \n    11 \n    73.3% \n    3 \n    27.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    26 \n    13 \n    50.0% \n    2 \n    15.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    15 \n    11 \n    73.3% \n    6 \n    54.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    14 \n    13 \n    92.9% \n    7 \n    53.8% \n    3 \n    42.9% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    19 \n    12 \n    63.2% \n    6 \n    50.0% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    416 \n    342 \n    82.2% \n    94 \n    27.5% \n    14 \n    14.9% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Timothy, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Timothy has conducted (n = 204), there have been 2 positive tests (0.98% of all HIV tests, 2/204). There have been a total of 2 positive CTR tests (1.03% of all CTR tests, 2/194) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/10).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Timothy has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/2). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.00% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/2) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Timothy’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/204), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/194) and 0.00% for EHE (0/10).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    204 \n    194 \n    10 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    2 \n    2 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Timothy has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/204), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Timothy currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/204). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Timothy is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Timothy does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Timothy, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Timothy has been involved with is 141 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Timothy’s cases that were “eligible” were 119 eligible LTC cases (84.4% of all LTC cases, 119/141). Timothy currently has an open case load of 17 open cases (14.3% of all eligible LTC cases, 17/119), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/17). Therefore, Timothy has successfully closed 103 LTC cases (86.6% of all eligible LTC cases, 103/119), with a total of 20 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (19.4% of all closed LTC cases, 20/103). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    141 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    119 \n    84.4% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    17 \n    14.3% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    103 \n    86.6% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    20 \n    19.4% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Timothy’s HIV linkage cases.\nTimothy has worked on a total of 14 HIV linkage cases (9.9% of all linkage cases, 14/141). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 1 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (7.1% of all HIV linkage cases, 1/14), and a total of 13 for those that have been previously diagnosed (92.9% of all HIV linkage cases, 13/14).\nA total of 9 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (64.3% of all HIV linkage cases, 9/14), and the reasons the remaining 5 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 1 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (11.1% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 1/9), and 8 were for those previously diagnosed (88.9% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 8/9). Timothy is currently working on 1 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 8 thus far (88.9% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 8/9). Out of those cases closed, a total of 6 were unable to be linked to care (75.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 6/8), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Timothy has successfully linked a total of 2 HIV linkage cases (25.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 2/8). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 1 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 1/1), and 1 were for those that were previously diagnosed (12.5% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 1/8).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Timothy’s HCV linkage cases.\nTimothy has worked on a total of 130 HCV linkage cases (92.2% of all linkage cases, 130/141). Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 48 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (36.9% of all HCV linkage cases, 48/130), and a total of 81 for those that have been previously diagnosed (62.3% of all HCV linkage cases, 81/130).\nA total of 111 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (85.4% of all HCV linkage cases, 111/130), and the reasons the remaining 19 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 43 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (38.7% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 43/111), and 67 were for those previously diagnosed (60.4% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 67/111). Timothy is currently working on 16 of these HCV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 95 thus far (85.6% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 95/111). Out of those cases closed, a total of 80 were unable to be linked to care (84.2% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 80/95), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Timothy has successfully linked a total of 15 HCV linkage cases (15.8% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 15/95). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 6 were for those newly diagnosed with HCV (14.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 6/43), and 9 were for those that were previously diagnosed (13.4% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 9/67).\n\n\nThe SUD Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Timothy’s SUD linkage cases.\nTimothy has worked on a total of 9 SUD linkage cases (6.4% of all linkage cases, 9/141).\nA total of 7 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (77.8% of all SUD linkage cases, 7/9), and the reasons the remaining 2 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nTimothy is currently working on 0 of these SUD linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 7 thus far (100.0% of all “eligible” SUD linkage cases, 7/7). Out of those cases closed, a total of 5 were unable to be linked to care (71.4% of all closed SUD linkage cases, 5/7), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram.
