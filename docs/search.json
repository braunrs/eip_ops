    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Zoe has conducted a total of 267 assessments, which means that 85.9% of Zoe’s encounters consisted of an assessment (267/321).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Zoe during this reporting period is 267, with 259 assessments having been screened for a SUD (97.0%, 259/267). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 12 that were positive for SUD (4.6%, 12/259).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    08/2025 \n    22 \n    22 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    13.6% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    56 \n    54 \n    96.4% \n    3 \n    5.6% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    58 \n    56 \n    96.6% \n    1 \n    1.8% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    15 \n    15 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    6.7% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    44 \n    43 \n    97.7% \n    1 \n    2.3% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    39 \n    38 \n    97.4% \n    3 \n    7.9% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    33 \n    31 \n    93.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    267 \n    259 \n    97.0% \n    12 \n    4.6% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 233 (87.3%, 233/267). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 233 (87.3%, 233/12). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 12), not all assessments (n = 267), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/233).

The total number of assessments Zoe conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 263 assessments (98.5% of all those assessed, 263/267). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 45 assessments (17.1% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 45/263). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 2 assessments (4.4% of all those eligible for PrEP, 2/45).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    08/2025 \n    22 \n    22 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    18.2% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    56 \n    56 \n    100.0% \n    9 \n    16.1% \n    1 \n    11.1% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    58 \n    55 \n    94.8% \n    8 \n    14.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    15 \n    15 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    26.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    44 \n    43 \n    97.7% \n    8 \n    18.6% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    39 \n    39 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    17.9% \n    1 \n    14.3% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    33 \n    33 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    15.2% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    267 \n    263 \n    98.5% \n    45 \n    17.1% \n    2 \n    4.4% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Zoe, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Zoe has conducted (n = 157), there have been 1 positive tests (0.64% of all HIV tests, 1/157). There have been a total of 1 positive CTR tests (0.66% of all CTR tests, 1/152) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/5).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Zoe has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/1). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.00% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/1) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Zoe’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/157), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/152) and 0.00% for EHE (0/5).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    157 \n    152 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Zoe has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/157), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Zoe currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/157). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.\nThere are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list. Those referral types are indicated within the table to the left as well as the figure below, and listed here: primary care (PCP), ED social work (SW), and Peer services.\nThe table to the left highlights the total number of referrals provided during the initial encounter as well as the total number of referrals provided during the linkage follow-up. These referrals do not necessarily mean that Zoe is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Zoe does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Zoe, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Zoe has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Zoe’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Zoe currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Zoe has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    0 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Zoe’s HIV linkage cases.\nZoe has worked on a total of 0 HIV linkage cases (0.0% of all linkage cases, 0/0). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 0 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and a total of 0 for those that have been previously diagnosed (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/0).\nA total of 0 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and the reasons the remaining 0 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 0 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0), and 0 were for those previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Zoe is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 0 thus far (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Out of those cases closed, a total of 0 were unable to be linked to care (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Tina has conducted a total of 87 assessments, which means that 79.8% of Tina’s encounters consisted of an assessment (87/119).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Tina during this reporting period is 87, with 82 assessments having been screened for a SUD (94.3%, 82/87). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 6 that were positive for SUD (7.3%, 6/82).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    10/2025 \n    8 \n    6 \n    75.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    23 \n    23 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    8.7% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    27 \n    26 \n    96.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    20 \n    19 \n    95.0% \n    2 \n    10.5% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    9 \n    8 \n    88.9% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    87 \n    82 \n    94.3% \n    6 \n    7.3% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 76 (87.4%, 76/87). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 76 (87.4%, 76/6). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 6), not all assessments (n = 87), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/76).

The total number of assessments Tina conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 79 assessments (90.8% of all those assessed, 79/87). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 20 assessments (25.3% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 20/79). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 3 assessments (15.0% of all those eligible for PrEP, 3/20).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    10/2025 \n    8 \n    6 \n    75.0% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    23 \n    21 \n    91.3% \n    8 \n    38.1% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    27 \n    25 \n    92.6% \n    5 \n    20.0% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    20 \n    18 \n    90.0% \n    3 \n    16.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    22.2% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    87 \n    79 \n    90.8% \n    20 \n    25.3% \n    3 \n    15.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Tina, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Tina has conducted (n = 49), there have been 2 positive tests (4.08% of all HIV tests, 2/49). There have been a total of 2 positive CTR tests (4.08% of all CTR tests, 2/49) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.0% of all EHE tests, 0/0).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Tina has identified a total of 2 new positive individuals (100.0% of all positive HIV tests, 2/2). This number is comprised of 2 new positives from CTR testing (100.00% percent of all CTR positive tests, 2/2) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Tina’s HIV testing is 4.08% (2/49), and for each program specifically is as follows: 4.08% for CTR (2/49) and 0.0% for EHE (0/0).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    49 \n    49 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    2 \n    2 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    2 \n    2 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    4.08% \n    4.08% \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Tina has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/49), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Tina currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/49). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Tina is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least.

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Tina does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Tina, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Tina has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Tina’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Tina currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Tina has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Sanaa has conducted a total of 34 assessments, which means that 70.8% of Sanaa’s encounters consisted of an assessment (34/176).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Sanaa during this reporting period is 34, with 32 assessments having been screened for a SUD (94.1%, 32/34). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 5 that were positive for SUD (15.6%, 5/32).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    05/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    23 \n    22 \n    95.7% \n    3 \n    13.6% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    7 \n    6 \n    85.7% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    34 \n    32 \n    94.1% \n    5 \n    15.6% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 22 (64.7%, 22/34). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 22 (64.7%, 22/5). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 5), not all assessments (n = 34), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/22).

The total number of assessments Sanaa conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 24 assessments (70.6% of all those assessed, 24/34). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 25 assessments (104.2% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 25/24). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider.

There have been a total of 2 positive CTR tests (12.50% of all CTR tests, 2/16) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/1).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Sanaa has identified a total of 2 new positive individuals (100.0% of all positive HIV tests, 2/2). This number is comprised of 2 new positives from CTR testing (100.00% percent of all CTR positive tests, 2/2) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Sanaa’s HIV testing is 11.76% (2/17), and for each program specifically is as follows: 12.50% for CTR (2/16) and 0.00% for EHE (0/1).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    17 \n    16 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    2 \n    2 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    2 \n    2 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    11.76% \n    12.50% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Sanaa has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/17), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Sanaa currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/17). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Sanaa is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Sanaa does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Sanaa, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Sanaa has been involved with is 131 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Sanaa’s cases that were “eligible” were 80 eligible LTC cases (61.1% of all LTC cases, 80/131). Sanaa currently has an open case load of 12 open cases (15.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 12/80), with 2 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (16.7% of all open LTC cases, 2/12). Therefore, Sanaa has successfully closed 71 LTC cases (88.7% of all eligible LTC cases, 71/80), with a total of 29 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (40.8% of all closed LTC cases, 29/71). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    131 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    80 \n    61.1% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    12 \n    15.0% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    2 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    71 \n    88.7% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    29 \n    40.8% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously.

Sanaa is currently working on 5 of these HIV linkage cases (40.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 0 thus far (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/5). Out of those cases closed, a total of 0 were unable to be linked to care (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Sanaa has successfully linked a total of 0 HIV linkage cases (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Pierre has conducted a total of 255 assessments, which means that 63.9% of Pierre’s encounters consisted of an assessment (255/681).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Pierre during this reporting period is 255, with 190 assessments having been screened for a SUD (74.5%, 190/255). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 43 that were positive for SUD (22.6%, 43/190).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2024 \n    12 \n    12 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    9 \n    8 \n    88.9% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    6 \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    8 \n    6 \n    75.0% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    19 \n    14 \n    73.7% \n    4 \n    28.6% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    25 \n    14 \n    56.0% \n    6 \n    42.9% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    24 \n    15 \n    62.5% \n    3 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    15 \n    9 \n    60.0% \n    1 \n    11.1% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    11 \n    7 \n    63.6% \n    1 \n    14.3% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    13 \n    12 \n    92.3% \n    3 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    4 \n    2 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    5 \n    1 \n    20.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    11 \n    6 \n    54.5% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    7 \n    5 \n    71.4% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    11 \n    5 \n    45.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    16 \n    14 \n    87.5% \n    1 \n    7.1% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    10 \n    10 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    8 \n    6 \n    75.0% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    11 \n    8 \n    72.7% \n    1 \n    12.5% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    26 \n    26 \n    100.0% \n    8 \n    30.8% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    255 \n    190 \n    74.5% \n    43 \n    22.6% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 177 (69.4%, 177/255). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 177 (69.4%, 177/43). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 43), not all assessments (n = 255), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 3 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (1.7%, 3/177). In regards to the specific conditions that were assessed, those are provided below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    Brief MH Assessed \n    % Brief MH Assessed \n    SUD +

eligibility is covered by several different questions scattered within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Pierre conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 85 assessments (33.3% of all those assessed, 85/255). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 25 assessments (29.4% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 25/85). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 3 assessments (12.0% of all those eligible for PrEP, 3/25).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2024 \n    12 \n    3 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    9 \n    3 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    6 \n    3 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    8 \n    2 \n    25.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    19 \n    6 \n    31.6% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    25 \n    5 \n    20.0% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    24 \n    4 \n    16.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    15 \n    3 \n    20.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    11 \n    2 \n    18.2% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    13 \n    6 \n    46.2% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    4 \n    1 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    5 \n    1 \n    20.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    11 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    7 \n    3 \n    42.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    11 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    16 \n    10 \n    62.5% \n    4 \n    40.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    10 \n    4 \n    40.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    8 \n    4 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    11 \n    3 \n    27.3% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    26 \n    20 \n    76.9% \n    3 \n    15.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    5 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    255 \n    85 \n    33.3% \n    25 \n    29.4% \n    3 \n    12.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Pierre, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Pierre has conducted (n = 145), there have been 1 positive tests (0.69% of all HIV tests, 1/145). There have been a total of 1 positive CTR tests (0.69% of all CTR tests, 1/145) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.0% of all EHE tests, 0/0).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Pierre has identified a total of 1 new positive individuals (100.0% of all positive HIV tests, 1/1). This number is comprised of 1 new positives from CTR testing (100.00% percent of all CTR positive tests, 1/1) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Pierre’s HIV testing is 0.69% (1/145), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.69% for CTR (1/145) and 0.0% for EHE (0/0).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    145 \n    145 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.69% \n    0.69% \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Pierre has had a total of 2 tests that have resulted in a false positive (1.4% of all HIV tests, 2/145), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Pierre currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/145). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up. Even if referrals are provided during the linkage process, they are represented here as any information gathered during the encounter could have led to that referral being provided. The referrals will be noted separately, but also as a combined total, and the referrals provided specifically during the linkage process will be repeated in the linkage to care section.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Encounter referral \n    Linkage referral \n  \n \n\n  \n    HIV \n    271 \n    14 \n  \n  \n    Hepatitis C \n    130 \n    7 \n  \n  \n    SUD \n    233 \n    24 \n  \n  \n    Human Trafficking \n    233 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Mental Health \n    243 \n    4 \n  \n  \n    Housing \n    245 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    PrEP \n    174 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    STI \n    218 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Food services \n    251 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Financial assistance \n    202 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Person abuse \n    236 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    General health \n    270 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    PCP* \n    221 \n     \n  \n  \n    ED SW* \n    149 \n     \n  \n  \n    Peer services* \n    172 \n     \n  \n  \n    Other \n    5 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    3253 \n    50 \n  \n\n\n* No linkage referral documentation\n\n\n\n\nReferrals are documented in the EIP database in three different ways at the encounter level: (1) provided information, such as brochures/pamphlets or referral lists with community programs, (2) provided internal referral for that service to one of EIP’s linkage coordinators, or (3) an external referral to a specific agency. Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.\nThere are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Pierre is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Pierre does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Pierre, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Pierre has been involved with is 124 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Pierre’s cases that were “eligible” were 94 eligible LTC cases (75.8% of all LTC cases, 94/124). Pierre currently has an open case load of 17 open cases (18.1% of all eligible LTC cases, 17/94), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/17). Therefore, Pierre has successfully closed 78 LTC cases (83.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 78/94), with a total of 17 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (21.8% of all closed LTC cases, 17/78). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    124 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    94 \n    75.8% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    17 \n    18.1% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    78 \n    83.0% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    17 \n    21.8% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Pierre’s HIV linkage cases.\nPierre has worked on a total of 19 HIV linkage cases (15.3% of all linkage cases, 19/124). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 1 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (5.3% of all HIV linkage cases, 1/19), and a total of 18 for those that have been previously diagnosed (94.7% of all HIV linkage cases, 18/19).\nA total of 6 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (31.6% of all HIV linkage cases, 6/19), and the reasons the remaining 13 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 0 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/6), and 6 were for those previously diagnosed (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 6/6). Pierre is currently working on 4 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 2 thus far (33.3% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 2/6). Out of those cases closed, a total of 1 were unable to be linked to care (50.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 1/2), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Pierre has successfully linked a total of 1 HIV linkage cases (50.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 1/2). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 0 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 0/0), and 1 were for those that were previously diagnosed (16.7% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 1/6).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Pierre’s HCV linkage cases.\nPierre has worked on a total of 106 HCV linkage cases (85.5% of all linkage cases, 106/124). Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 42 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (39.6% of all HCV linkage cases, 42/106), and a total of 63 for those that have been previously diagnosed (59.4% of all HCV linkage cases, 63/106).\nA total of 84 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (79.2% of all HCV linkage cases, 84/106), and the reasons the remaining 22 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 38 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (45.2% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 38/84), and 45 were for those previously diagnosed (53.6% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 45/84). Pierre is currently working on 11 of these HCV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 73 thus far (86.9% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 73/84). Out of those cases closed, a total of 59 were unable to be linked to care (80.8% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 59/73), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Pierre has successfully linked a total of 14 HCV linkage cases (19.2% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 14/73). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 4 were for those newly diagnosed with HCV (10.5% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 4/38), and 9 were for those that were previously diagnosed (20.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 9/45).\n\n\nThe SUD Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Pierre’s SUD linkage cases.\nPierre has worked on a total of 8 SUD linkage cases (6.5% of all linkage cases, 8/124).\nA total of 6 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (75.0% of all SUD linkage cases, 6/8), and the reasons the remaining 2 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nPierre is currently working on 2 of these SUD linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 4 thus far (66.7% of all “eligible” SUD linkage cases, 4/6). Out of those cases closed, a total of 1 were unable to be linked to care (25.0% of all closed SUD linkage cases, 1/4), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Pierre has successfully linked a total of 3 SUD linkage cases (75.0% of all closed SUD linkage cases, 3/4).\n\n\nThe Human Trafficking (HT) Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Pierre’s HT linkage cases.\nPierre has worked on a total of 0 HT linkage cases (0.0% of all linkage cases, 0/124).\nA total of 0 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (0.0% of all HT linkage cases, 0/0), and the reasons the remaining 0 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nPierre is currently working on 0 of these HT linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 0 thus far (0.0% of all “eligible” HT linkage cases, 0/0).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Noah has conducted a total of 159 assessments, which means that 78.3% of Noah’s encounters consisted of an assessment (159/848).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Noah during this reporting period is 159, with 141 assessments having been screened for a SUD (88.7%, 141/159). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 24 that were positive for SUD (17.0%, 24/141).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2024 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    21 \n    18 \n    85.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    13 \n    12 \n    92.3% \n    1 \n    8.3% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    8 \n    4 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    8 \n    7 \n    87.5% \n    1 \n    14.3% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    9 \n    6 \n    66.7% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    8 \n    6 \n    75.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    3 \n    1 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    9.1% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    29.4% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    11.1% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    6 \n    5 \n    83.3% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    6 \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    83.3% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    159 \n    141 \n    88.7% \n    24 \n    17.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 36 (22.6%, 36/159). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 36 (22.6%, 36/24). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 24), not all assessments (n = 159), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/36). In regards to the specific conditions that were assessed, those are provided below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    Brief MH Assessed \n    % Brief MH Assessed \n    SUD +

may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Noah conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 147 assessments (92.5% of all those assessed, 147/159). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 85 assessments (57.8% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 85/147). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 13 assessments (15.3% of all those eligible for PrEP, 13/85).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2024 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    21 \n    20 \n    95.2% \n    6 \n    30.0% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    13 \n    13 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    23.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    133.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    300.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    8 \n    5 \n    62.5% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    75.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    8 \n    5 \n    62.5% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    9 \n    8 \n    88.9% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    8 \n    7 \n    87.5% \n    3 \n    42.9% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    3 \n    150.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    63.6% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    10 \n    58.8% \n    2 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    44.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    140.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    6 \n    5 \n    83.3% \n    6 \n    120.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    6 \n    5 \n    83.3% \n    3 \n    60.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    120.0% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    159 \n    147 \n    92.5% \n    85 \n    57.8% \n    13 \n    15.3% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Noah, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Noah has conducted (n = 152), there have been 1 positive tests (0.66% of all HIV tests, 1/152). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/107) and a total of 1 positive EHE tests (2.22% of all EHE tests, 1/45).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Noah has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/1). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.00% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/1). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Noah’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/152), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/107) and 0.00% for EHE (0/45).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    152 \n    107 \n    45 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Noah has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/152), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Noah currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/152). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Noah is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Noah does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Noah, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Noah has been involved with is 663 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Noah’s cases that were “eligible” were 429 eligible LTC cases (64.7% of all LTC cases, 429/663). Noah currently has an open case load of 24 open cases (5.6% of all eligible LTC cases, 24/429), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/24). Therefore, Noah has successfully closed 405 LTC cases (94.4% of all eligible LTC cases, 405/429), with a total of 173 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (42.7% of all closed LTC cases, 173/405). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    663 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    429 \n    64.7% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    24 \n    5.6% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    405 \n    94.4% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    173 \n    42.7% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Noah’s HIV linkage cases.\nNoah has worked on a total of 20 HIV linkage cases (3.0% of all linkage cases, 20/663). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 0 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/20), and a total of 20 for those that have been previously diagnosed (100.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 20/20).\nA total of 9 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (45.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 9/20), and the reasons the remaining 11 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 0 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/9), and 9 were for those previously diagnosed (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 9/9). Noah is currently working on 1 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 8 thus far (88.9% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 8/9). Out of those cases closed, a total of 7 were unable to be linked to care (87.5% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 7/8), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Noah has successfully linked a total of 1 HIV linkage cases (12.5% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 1/8). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 0 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 0/0), and 1 were for those that were previously diagnosed (11.1% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 1/9).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Noah’s HCV linkage cases.\nNoah has worked on a total of 69 HCV linkage cases (10.4% of all linkage cases, 69/663). Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 16 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (23.2% of all HCV linkage cases, 16/69), and a total of 51 for those that have been previously diagnosed (73.9% of all HCV linkage cases, 51/69).\nA total of 55 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (79.7% of all HCV linkage cases, 55/69), and the reasons the remaining 14 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 11 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (20.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 11/55), and 42 were for those previously diagnosed (76.4% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 42/55). Noah is currently working on 1 of these HCV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 54 thus far (98.2% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 54/55). Out of those cases closed, a total of 40 were unable to be linked to care (74.1% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 40/54), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Maria has conducted a total of 60 assessments, which means that 83.3% of Maria’s encounters consisted of an assessment (60/77).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Maria during this reporting period is 60, with 55 assessments having been screened for a SUD (91.7%, 55/60). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 8 that were positive for SUD (14.5%, 8/55).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    09/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    16 \n    15 \n    93.8% \n    1 \n    6.7% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    20 \n    20 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    15.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    12 \n    9 \n    75.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    9 \n    8 \n    88.9% \n    3 \n    37.5% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    60 \n    55 \n    91.7% \n    8 \n    14.5% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 39 (65.0%, 39/60). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 39 (65.0%, 39/8). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 8), not all assessments (n = 60), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/39).

The total number of assessments Maria conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 53 assessments (88.3% of all those assessed, 53/60). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 14 assessments (26.4% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 14/53). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 3 assessments (21.4% of all those eligible for PrEP, 3/14).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    09/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    16 \n    14 \n    87.5% \n    4 \n    28.6% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    20 \n    19 \n    95.0% \n    6 \n    31.6% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    12 \n    9 \n    75.0% \n    2 \n    22.2% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    9 \n    8 \n    88.9% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    60 \n    53 \n    88.3% \n    14 \n    26.4% \n    3 \n    21.4% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/29) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.0% of all EHE tests, 0/0).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Maria has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Maria’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/29), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/29) and 0.0% for EHE (0/0).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    29 \n    29 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Maria has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/29), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Maria currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/29). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Maria is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least.

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Maria does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Maria, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Maria has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Maria’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Maria currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Maria has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Kirsten has conducted a total of 108 assessments, which means that 72.5% of Kirsten’s encounters consisted of an assessment (108/158).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Kirsten during this reporting period is 108, with 105 assessments having been screened for a SUD (97.2%, 105/108). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 9 that were positive for SUD (8.6%, 9/105).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    08/2025 \n    15 \n    15 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    6.7% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    35 \n    33 \n    94.3% \n    2 \n    6.1% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    16 \n    16 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    14 \n    14 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    7.1% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    17 \n    16 \n    94.1% \n    4 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    6 \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    108 \n    105 \n    97.2% \n    9 \n    8.6% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 94 (87.0%, 94/108). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 94 (87.0%, 94/9). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 9), not all assessments (n = 108), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/94).

The total number of assessments Kirsten conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 99 assessments (91.7% of all those assessed, 99/108). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 24 assessments (24.2% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 24/99). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 8 assessments (33.3% of all those eligible for PrEP, 8/24).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    08/2025 \n    15 \n    14 \n    93.3% \n    3 \n    21.4% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    35 \n    31 \n    88.6% \n    10 \n    32.3% \n    3 \n    30.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    16 \n    16 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    25.0% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    14 \n    12 \n    85.7% \n    4 \n    33.3% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    5 \n    4 \n    80.0% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    17 \n    16 \n    94.1% \n    2 \n    12.5% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    6 \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    108 \n    99 \n    91.7% \n    24 \n    24.2% \n    8 \n    33.3% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Kirsten, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Kirsten has conducted (n = 64), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/64). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/60) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/4).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Kirsten has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Kirsten’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/64), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/60) and 0.00% for EHE (0/4).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    64 \n    60 \n    4 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Kirsten has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/64), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Kirsten currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/64). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

The referrals will be noted separately, but also as a combined total, and the referrals provided specifically during the linkage process will be repeated in the linkage to care section.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Encounter referral \n    Linkage referral \n  \n \n\n  \n    HIV \n    131 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Hepatitis C \n    129 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    SUD \n    131 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    Human Trafficking \n    130 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Mental Health \n    130 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Housing \n    131 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    PrEP \n    114 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    STI \n    129 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Food services \n    131 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Financial assistance \n    129 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Person abuse \n    131 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    General health \n    131 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    PCP* \n    124 \n     \n  \n  \n    ED SW* \n    0 \n     \n  \n  \n    Peer services* \n    1 \n     \n  \n  \n    Other \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    1672 \n    3 \n  \n\n\n* No linkage referral documentation\n\n\n\n\nReferrals are documented in the EIP database in three different ways at the encounter level: (1) provided information, such as brochures/pamphlets or referral lists with community programs, (2) provided internal referral for that service to one of EIP’s linkage coordinators, or (3) an external referral to a specific agency. Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.\nThere are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list. Those referral types are indicated within the table to the left as well as the figure below, and listed here: primary care (PCP), ED social work (SW), and Peer services.\nThe table to the left highlights the total number of referrals provided during the initial encounter as well as the total number of referrals provided during the linkage follow-up. These referrals do not necessarily mean that Kirsten is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Kirsten does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Kirsten, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Kirsten has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Kirsten’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Kirsten currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Kirsten has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    0 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously.

Kirsten is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 0 thus far (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Out of those cases closed, a total of 0 were unable to be linked to care (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Kirsten has successfully linked a total of 0 HIV linkage cases (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 0 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 0/0), and 0 were for those that were previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 0/0).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Katie has conducted a total of 317 assessments, which means that 55.2% of Katie’s encounters consisted of an assessment (317/990).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Katie during this reporting period is 317, with 289 assessments having been screened for a SUD (91.2%, 289/317). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 88 that were positive for SUD (30.4%, 88/289).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2024 \n    25 \n    25 \n    100.0% \n    10 \n    40.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    32 \n    31 \n    96.9% \n    15 \n    48.4% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    35 \n    34 \n    97.1% \n    15 \n    44.1% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    16 \n    16 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    37.5% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    23 \n    20 \n    87.0% \n    13 \n    65.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    21 \n    21 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    28.6% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    27 \n    26 \n    96.3% \n    8 \n    30.8% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    27 \n    23 \n    85.2% \n    5 \n    21.7% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    19 \n    17 \n    89.5% \n    3 \n    17.6% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    20 \n    19 \n    95.0% \n    2 \n    10.5% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    14 \n    9 \n    64.3% \n    2 \n    22.2% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    6 \n    5 \n    83.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    7 \n    6 \n    85.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    7 \n    6 \n    85.7% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    4 \n    1 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    2 \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    7 \n    6 \n    85.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    317 \n    289 \n    91.2% \n    88 \n    30.4% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 101 (31.9%, 101/317). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 101 (31.9%, 101/88). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 88), not all assessments (n = 317), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/101). In regards to the specific conditions that were assessed, those are provided below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    Brief MH Assessed \n    % Brief MH Assessed \n    SUD +

be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Katie conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 257 assessments (81.1% of all those assessed, 257/317). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 76 assessments (29.6% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 76/257). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 16 assessments (21.1% of all those eligible for PrEP, 16/76).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2024 \n    25 \n    25 \n    100.0% \n    11 \n    44.0% \n    3 \n    27.3% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    32 \n    23 \n    71.9% \n    4 \n    17.4% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    35 \n    26 \n    74.3% \n    7 \n    26.9% \n    2 \n    28.6% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    16 \n    12 \n    75.0% \n    3 \n    25.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    23 \n    19 \n    82.6% \n    9 \n    47.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    21 \n    17 \n    81.0% \n    5 \n    29.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    27 \n    20 \n    74.1% \n    2 \n    10.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    27 \n    21 \n    77.8% \n    7 \n    33.3% \n    1 \n    14.3% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    19 \n    16 \n    84.2% \n    3 \n    18.8% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    20 \n    15 \n    75.0% \n    1 \n    6.7% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    14 \n    10 \n    71.4% \n    1 \n    10.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    6 \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    400.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    7 \n    6 \n    85.7% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    14.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    8 \n    7 \n    87.5% \n    4 \n    57.1% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    4 \n    3 \n    75.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    4 \n    3 \n    75.0% \n    4 \n    133.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    317 \n    257 \n    81.1% \n    76 \n    29.6% \n    16 \n    21.1% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Katie, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Katie has conducted (n = 303), there have been 1 positive tests (0.33% of all HIV tests, 1/303). There have been a total of 1 positive CTR tests (0.60% of all CTR tests, 1/168) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/135).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Katie has identified a total of 1 new positive individuals (100.0% of all positive HIV tests, 1/1). This number is comprised of 1 new positives from CTR testing (100.00% percent of all CTR positive tests, 1/1) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Katie’s HIV testing is 0.33% (1/303), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.60% for CTR (1/168) and 0.00% for EHE (0/135).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    303 \n    168 \n    135 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.33% \n    0.60% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Katie has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/303), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Katie currently has a total of 1 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.3% of all HIV tests, 1/303). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Katie is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Katie does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Katie, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Katie has been involved with is 259 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Katie’s cases that were “eligible” were 226 eligible LTC cases (87.3% of all LTC cases, 226/259). Katie currently has an open case load of 4 open cases (1.8% of all eligible LTC cases, 4/226), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/4). Therefore, Katie has successfully closed 222 LTC cases (98.2% of all eligible LTC cases, 222/226), with a total of 53 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (23.9% of all closed LTC cases, 53/222). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    259 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    226 \n    87.3% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    4 \n    1.8% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    222 \n    98.2% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    53 \n    23.9% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Katie’s HIV linkage cases.\nKatie has worked on a total of 38 HIV linkage cases (14.7% of all linkage cases, 38/259). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 11 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (28.9% of all HIV linkage cases, 11/38), and a total of 27 for those that have been previously diagnosed (71.1% of all HIV linkage cases, 27/38).\nA total of 30 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (78.9% of all HIV linkage cases, 30/38), and the reasons the remaining 8 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 11 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (36.7% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 11/30), and 19 were for those previously diagnosed (63.3% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 19/30). Katie is currently working on 4 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 26 thus far (86.7% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 26/30). Out of those cases closed, a total of 11 were unable to be linked to care (42.3% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 11/26), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Katie has successfully linked a total of 15 HIV linkage cases (57.7% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 15/26). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 8 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (72.7% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 8/11), and 7 were for those that were previously diagnosed (36.8% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 7/19).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Katie’s HCV linkage cases.\nKatie has worked on a total of 209 HCV linkage cases (80.7% of all linkage cases, 209/259). Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 88 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (42.1% of all HCV linkage cases, 88/209), and a total of 119 for those that have been previously diagnosed (56.9% of all HCV linkage cases, 119/209).\nA total of 183 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (87.6% of all HCV linkage cases, 183/209), and the reasons the remaining 26 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 80 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (43.7% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 80/183), and 101 were for those previously diagnosed (55.2% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 101/183). Katie is currently working on 0 of these HCV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 183 thus far (100.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 183/183). Out of those cases closed, a total of 150 were unable to be linked to care (82.0% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 150/183), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Katie has successfully linked a total of 33 HCV linkage cases (18.0% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 33/183).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Emma has conducted a total of 221 assessments, which means that 78.1% of Emma’s encounters consisted of an assessment (221/313).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Emma during this reporting period is 221, with 196 assessments having been screened for a SUD (88.7%, 196/221). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 31 that were positive for SUD (15.8%, 31/196).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    04/2025 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    11.1% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    20 \n    16 \n    80.0% \n    2 \n    12.5% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    24 \n    22 \n    91.7% \n    4 \n    18.2% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    26 \n    24 \n    92.3% \n    6 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    33 \n    32 \n    97.0% \n    3 \n    9.4% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    37 \n    32 \n    86.5% \n    6 \n    18.8% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    17 \n    14 \n    82.4% \n    2 \n    14.3% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    11 \n    10 \n    90.9% \n    2 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    25 \n    20 \n    80.0% \n    2 \n    10.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    10 \n    9 \n    90.0% \n    1 \n    11.1% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    9 \n    8 \n    88.9% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    221 \n    196 \n    88.7% \n    31 \n    15.8% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 66 (29.9%, 66/221). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 66 (29.9%, 66/31). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 31), not all assessments (n = 221), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/66).

The total number of assessments Emma conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 176 assessments (79.6% of all those assessed, 176/221). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 65 assessments (36.9% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 65/176). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 34 assessments (52.3% of all those eligible for PrEP, 34/65).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    04/2025 \n    9 \n    7 \n    77.8% \n    3 \n    42.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    20 \n    17 \n    85.0% \n    6 \n    35.3% \n    3 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    24 \n    16 \n    66.7% \n    2 \n    12.5% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    26 \n    16 \n    61.5% \n    4 \n    25.0% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    33 \n    28 \n    84.8% \n    6 \n    21.4% \n    5 \n    83.3% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    37 \n    30 \n    81.1% \n    15 \n    50.0% \n    13 \n    86.7% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    17 \n    12 \n    70.6% \n    11 \n    91.7% \n    5 \n    45.5% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    27.3% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    25 \n    22 \n    88.0% \n    9 \n    40.9% \n    3 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    10 \n    9 \n    90.0% \n    1 \n    11.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    9 \n    8 \n    88.9% \n    5 \n    62.5% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    221 \n    176 \n    79.6% \n    65 \n    36.9% \n    34 \n    52.3% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Emma has conducted (n = 123), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/123). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/122) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/1).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Emma has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Emma’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/123), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/122) and 0.00% for EHE (0/1).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    123 \n    122 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Emma has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/123), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Emma currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/123). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Emma is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Emma does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Emma, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Emma has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Emma’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Emma currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Emma has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below.

The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Chloe has conducted a total of 170 assessments, which means that 84.2% of Chloe’s encounters consisted of an assessment (170/298).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Chloe during this reporting period is 170, with 160 assessments having been screened for a SUD (94.1%, 160/170).

If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 0 (0.0%, 0/170). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 0 (0.0%, 0/0). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 0), not all assessments (n = 170), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (NA, 0/0).

the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Chloe conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 166 assessments (97.6% of all those assessed, 166/170). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 82 assessments (49.4% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 82/166). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 53 assessments (64.6% of all those eligible for PrEP, 53/82).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2024 \n    18 \n    17 \n    94.4% \n    14 \n    82.4% \n    7 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    45.5% \n    4 \n    80.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    87.5% \n    6 \n    85.7% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    12 \n    11 \n    91.7% \n    6 \n    54.5% \n    6 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    42.9% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    9 \n    52.9% \n    6 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    28.6% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    27.3% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    28.6% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    57.1% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    9 \n    8 \n    88.9% \n    5 \n    62.5% \n    3 \n    60.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    50.0% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    6 \n    5 \n    83.3% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    37.5% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    6 \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    50.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    170 \n    166 \n    97.6% \n    82 \n    49.4% \n    53 \n    64.6% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Chloe, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Chloe has conducted (n = 191), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/191). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/117) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/74).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Chloe has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Chloe’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/191), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/117) and 0.00% for EHE (0/74).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    191 \n    117 \n    74 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Chloe has had a total of 1 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.5% of all HIV tests, 1/191), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Chloe currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/191). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Chloe is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Chloe does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Chloe, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Chloe has been involved with is 85 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Chloe’s cases that were “eligible” were 69 eligible LTC cases (81.2% of all LTC cases, 69/85). Chloe currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/69), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Chloe has successfully closed 69 LTC cases (100.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 69/69), with a total of 22 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (31.9% of all closed LTC cases, 22/69). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    85 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    69 \n    81.2% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    69 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    22 \n    31.9% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Chloe’s HIV linkage cases.\nChloe has worked on a total of 25 HIV linkage cases (29.4% of all linkage cases, 25/85). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 2 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (8.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 2/25), and a total of 23 for those that have been previously diagnosed (92.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 23/25).\nA total of 16 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (64.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 16/25), and the reasons the remaining 9 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 2 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (12.5% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 2/16), and 14 were for those previously diagnosed (87.5% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 14/16). Chloe is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 16 thus far (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 16/16). Out of those cases closed, a total of 7 were unable to be linked to care (43.8% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 7/16), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Chloe has successfully linked a total of 9 HIV linkage cases (56.2% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 9/16).

These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Chloe has successfully linked a total of 10 HCV linkage cases (23.3% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 10/43). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 1 were for those newly diagnosed with HCV (20.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 1/5), and 9 were for those that were previously diagnosed (27.3% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 9/33).\n\n\nThe SUD Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Chloe’s SUD linkage cases.\nChloe has worked on a total of 5 SUD linkage cases (5.9% of all linkage cases, 5/85).\nA total of 4 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (80.0% of all SUD linkage cases, 4/5), and the reasons the remaining 1 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nChloe is currently working on 0 of these SUD linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 4 thus far (100.0% of all “eligible” SUD linkage cases, 4/4). Out of those cases closed, a total of 3 were unable to be linked to care (75.0% of all closed SUD linkage cases, 3/4), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Chloe has successfully linked a total of 1 SUD linkage cases (25.0% of all closed SUD linkage cases, 1/4).\n\n\nThe Human Trafficking (HT) Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Chloe’s HT linkage cases.\nChloe has worked on a total of 1 HT linkage cases (1.2% of all linkage cases, 1/85).\nA total of 1 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (100.0% of all HT linkage cases, 1/1), and the reasons the remaining 0 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nChloe is currently working on 0 of these HT linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 1 thus far (100.0% of all “eligible” HT linkage cases, 1/1).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Claudia has conducted a total of 206 assessments, which means that 91.2% of Claudia’s encounters consisted of an assessment (206/241).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Claudia during this reporting period is 206, with 195 assessments having been screened for a SUD (94.7%, 195/206). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 42 that were positive for SUD (21.5%, 42/195).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    10/2025 \n    27 \n    24 \n    88.9% \n    3 \n    12.5% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    52 \n    50 \n    96.2% \n    8 \n    16.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    35 \n    32 \n    91.4% \n    10 \n    31.2% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    62 \n    59 \n    95.2% \n    12 \n    20.3% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    30 \n    30 \n    100.0% \n    9 \n    30.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    206 \n    195 \n    94.7% \n    42 \n    21.5% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 146 (70.9%, 146/206). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 146 (70.9%, 146/42). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 42), not all assessments (n = 206), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/146).

The total number of assessments Claudia conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 179 assessments (86.9% of all those assessed, 179/206). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 71 assessments (39.7% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 71/179). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 4 assessments (5.6% of all those eligible for PrEP, 4/71).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    10/2025 \n    27 \n    21 \n    77.8% \n    6 \n    28.6% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    52 \n    45 \n    86.5% \n    17 \n    37.8% \n    1 \n    5.9% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    35 \n    28 \n    80.0% \n    12 \n    42.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    62 \n    55 \n    88.7% \n    23 \n    41.8% \n    2 \n    8.7% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    30 \n    30 \n    100.0% \n    13 \n    43.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    206 \n    179 \n    86.9% \n    71 \n    39.7% \n    4 \n    5.6% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

    "text": "HIV Testing\nThe total number of HIV tests, including both CTR and EHE tests, are shown in the plot below. These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Claudia, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Claudia has conducted (n = 69), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/69). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/69) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.0% of all EHE tests, 0/0).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Claudia has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Claudia’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/69), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/69) and 0.0% for EHE (0/0).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    69 \n    69 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Claudia has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/69), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Claudia currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/69). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up. Even if referrals are provided during the linkage process, they are represented here as any information gathered during the encounter could have led to that referral being provided.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Claudia is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Claudia does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Claudia, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Claudia has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Claudia’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Claudia currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Claudia has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0).

The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Ashley has conducted a total of 95 assessments, which means that 87.2% of Ashley’s encounters consisted of an assessment (95/114).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Ashley during this reporting period is 95, with 88 assessments having been screened for a SUD (92.6%, 88/95). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 11 that were positive for SUD (12.5%, 11/88).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    10/2025 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    19 \n    16 \n    84.2% \n    4 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    18 \n    17 \n    94.4% \n    4 \n    23.5% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    31 \n    29 \n    93.5% \n    3 \n    10.3% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    18 \n    17 \n    94.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    95 \n    88 \n    92.6% \n    11 \n    12.5% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 70 (73.7%, 70/95). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 70 (73.7%, 70/11). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 11), not all assessments (n = 95), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/70).

The total number of assessments Ashley conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 79 assessments (83.2% of all those assessed, 79/95). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 28 assessments (35.4% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 28/79). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 2 assessments (7.1% of all those eligible for PrEP, 2/28).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    10/2025 \n    9 \n    4 \n    44.4% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    19 \n    16 \n    84.2% \n    4 \n    25.0% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    18 \n    16 \n    88.9% \n    7 \n    43.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    31 \n    26 \n    83.9% \n    9 \n    34.6% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    18 \n    17 \n    94.4% \n    6 \n    35.3% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    95 \n    79 \n    83.2% \n    28 \n    35.4% \n    2 \n    7.1% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/41) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.0% of all EHE tests, 0/0).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Ashley has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Ashley’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/41), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/41) and 0.0% for EHE (0/0).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    41 \n    41 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Ashley has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/41), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Ashley currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/41). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Ashley does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Ashley, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Ashley has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Ashley’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Ashley currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Ashley has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below.

Ashley is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 0 thus far (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0). Out of those cases closed, a total of 0 were unable to be linked to care (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/0), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Brooke has conducted a total of 406 assessments, which means that 87.7% of Brooke’s encounters consisted of an assessment (406/487).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Brooke during this reporting period is 406, with 347 assessments having been screened for a SUD (85.5%, 347/406). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 51 that were positive for SUD (14.7%, 51/347).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    11/2024 \n    19 \n    14 \n    73.7% \n    4 \n    28.6% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    19 \n    18 \n    94.7% \n    6 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    23 \n    18 \n    78.3% \n    1 \n    5.6% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    18 \n    13 \n    72.2% \n    1 \n    7.7% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    27 \n    24 \n    88.9% \n    1 \n    4.2% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    33 \n    29 \n    87.9% \n    2 \n    6.9% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    29 \n    26 \n    89.7% \n    2 \n    7.7% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    38 \n    31 \n    81.6% \n    5 \n    16.1% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    50 \n    41 \n    82.0% \n    7 \n    17.1% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    25 \n    24 \n    96.0% \n    3 \n    12.5% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    31 \n    23 \n    74.2% \n    7 \n    30.4% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    36 \n    32 \n    88.9% \n    5 \n    15.6% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    19 \n    17 \n    89.5% \n    1 \n    5.9% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    8 \n    6 \n    75.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    11.8% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    14 \n    14 \n    100.0% \n    4 \n    28.6% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    406 \n    347 \n    85.5% \n    51 \n    14.7% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 306 (75.4%, 306/406). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 306 (75.4%, 306/51). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 51), not all assessments (n = 406), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/306).

Prophylaxis (PrEP)\nPrEP eligibility is covered by several different questions scattered within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Brooke conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 323 assessments (79.6% of all those assessed, 323/406). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 65 assessments (20.1% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 65/323). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 10 assessments (15.4% of all those eligible for PrEP, 10/65).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    11/2024 \n    19 \n    10 \n    52.6% \n    1 \n    10.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    19 \n    15 \n    78.9% \n    3 \n    20.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    23 \n    17 \n    73.9% \n    5 \n    29.4% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    18 \n    14 \n    77.8% \n    2 \n    14.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    27 \n    23 \n    85.2% \n    3 \n    13.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    33 \n    28 \n    84.8% \n    8 \n    28.6% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    29 \n    26 \n    89.7% \n    4 \n    15.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    38 \n    26 \n    68.4% \n    6 \n    23.1% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    50 \n    39 \n    78.0% \n    6 \n    15.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    25 \n    21 \n    84.0% \n    6 \n    28.6% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    31 \n    22 \n    71.0% \n    2 \n    9.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    36 \n    30 \n    83.3% \n    4 \n    13.3% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    19 \n    17 \n    89.5% \n    3 \n    17.6% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    12.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    17 \n    16 \n    94.1% \n    6 \n    37.5% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    14 \n    11 \n    78.6% \n    5 \n    45.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    406 \n    323 \n    79.6% \n    65 \n    20.1% \n    10 \n    15.4% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Brooke has conducted (n = 189), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/189). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/187) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/2).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Brooke has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Brooke’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/189), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/187) and 0.00% for EHE (0/2).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    189 \n    187 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Brooke has had a total of 1 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.5% of all HIV tests, 1/189), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Brooke currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/189). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Brooke is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Brooke does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Brooke, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Brooke has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Brooke’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Brooke currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Brooke has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    0 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Brooke’s HIV linkage cases.\nBrooke has worked on a total of 0 HIV linkage cases (0.0% of all linkage cases, 0/0).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Connor has conducted a total of 264 assessments, which means that 83.5% of Connor’s encounters consisted of an assessment (264/566).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Connor during this reporting period is 264, with 252 assessments having been screened for a SUD (95.5%, 252/264). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 52 that were positive for SUD (20.6%, 52/252).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    11/2024 \n    22 \n    20 \n    90.9% \n    5 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    10 \n    9 \n    90.0% \n    2 \n    22.2% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    8 \n    8 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    7 \n    7 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    10 \n    10 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    30.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    19 \n    19 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    45 \n    45 \n    100.0% \n    9 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    46 \n    42 \n    91.3% \n    11 \n    26.2% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    39 \n    38 \n    97.4% \n    10 \n    26.3% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    19 \n    18 \n    94.7% \n    5 \n    27.8% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    11.1% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    10 \n    9 \n    90.0% \n    2 \n    22.2% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    9 \n    8 \n    88.9% \n    1 \n    12.5% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    264 \n    252 \n    95.5% \n    52 \n    20.6% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 196 (74.2%, 196/264). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 196 (74.2%, 196/52). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 52), not all assessments (n = 264), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/196).

scattered within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Connor conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 187 assessments (70.8% of all those assessed, 187/264). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 49 assessments (26.2% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 49/187). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 4 assessments (8.2% of all those eligible for PrEP, 4/49).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    11/2024 \n    22 \n    19 \n    86.4% \n    2 \n    10.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    10 \n    8 \n    80.0% \n    2 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    8 \n    4 \n    50.0% \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    7 \n    5 \n    71.4% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    10 \n    9 \n    90.0% \n    1 \n    11.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    19 \n    14 \n    73.7% \n    6 \n    42.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    45 \n    34 \n    75.6% \n    1 \n    2.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    46 \n    22 \n    47.8% \n    6 \n    27.3% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    39 \n    26 \n    66.7% \n    5 \n    19.2% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    19 \n    17 \n    89.5% \n    1 \n    5.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    9 \n    6 \n    66.7% \n    3 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    10 \n    8 \n    80.0% \n    6 \n    75.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    4 \n    3 \n    75.0% \n    5 \n    166.7% \n    1 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    75.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    9 \n    6 \n    66.7% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    264 \n    187 \n    70.8% \n    49 \n    26.2% \n    4 \n    8.2% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Connor, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Connor has conducted (n = 151), there have been 2 positive tests (1.32% of all HIV tests, 2/151). There have been a total of 2 positive CTR tests (1.59% of all CTR tests, 2/126) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/25).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Connor has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/2). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.00% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/2) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Connor’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/151), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/126) and 0.00% for EHE (0/25).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    151 \n    126 \n    25 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    2 \n    2 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Connor has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/151), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Connor currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/151). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up.

Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.\nThere are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list. Those referral types are indicated within the table to the left as well as the figure below, and listed here: primary care (PCP), ED social work (SW), and Peer services.\nThe table to the left highlights the total number of referrals provided during the initial encounter as well as the total number of referrals provided during the linkage follow-up. These referrals do not necessarily mean that Connor is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Connor does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Connor, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Connor has been involved with is 249 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Connor’s cases that were “eligible” were 175 eligible LTC cases (70.3% of all LTC cases, 175/249). Connor currently has an open case load of 26 open cases (14.9% of all eligible LTC cases, 26/175), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/26). Therefore, Connor has successfully closed 150 LTC cases (85.7% of all eligible LTC cases, 150/175), with a total of 37 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (24.7% of all closed LTC cases, 37/150). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    249 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    175 \n    70.3% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    26 \n    14.9% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    150 \n    85.7% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    37 \n    24.7% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Connor’s HIV linkage cases.\nConnor has worked on a total of 74 HIV linkage cases (29.7% of all linkage cases, 74/249). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 8 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (10.8% of all HIV linkage cases, 8/74), and a total of 64 for those that have been previously diagnosed (86.5% of all HIV linkage cases, 64/74).\nA total of 33 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (44.6% of all HIV linkage cases, 33/74), and the reasons the remaining 41 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 8 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (24.2% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 8/33), and 23 were for those previously diagnosed (69.7% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 23/33). Connor is currently working on 12 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 21 thus far (63.6% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 21/33). Out of those cases closed, a total of 13 were unable to be linked to care (61.9% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 13/21), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Connor has successfully linked a total of 8 HIV linkage cases (38.1% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 8/21). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 4 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (50.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 4/8), and 4 were for those that were previously diagnosed (17.4% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 4/23).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Connor’s HCV linkage cases.\nConnor has worked on a total of 179 HCV linkage cases (71.9% of all linkage cases, 179/249). Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 50 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (27.9% of all HCV linkage cases, 50/179), and a total of 129 for those that have been previously diagnosed (72.1% of all HCV linkage cases, 129/179).\nA total of 140 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (78.2% of all HCV linkage cases, 140/179), and the reasons the remaining 39 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 41 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (29.3% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 41/140), and 99 were for those previously diagnosed (70.7% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 99/140). Connor is currently working on 14 of these HCV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 126 thus far (90.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 126/140). Out of those cases closed, a total of 101 were unable to be linked to care (80.2% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 101/126), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Connor has successfully linked a total of 25 HCV linkage cases (19.8% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 25/126). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 6 were for those newly diagnosed with HCV (14.6% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 6/41), and 19 were for those that were previously diagnosed (19.2% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 19/99).\n\n\nThe SUD Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Connor’s SUD linkage cases.\nConnor has worked on a total of 18 SUD linkage cases (7.2% of all linkage cases, 18/249).\nA total of 13 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (72.2% of all SUD linkage cases, 13/18), and the reasons the remaining 5 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nConnor is currently working on 1 of these SUD linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 12 thus far (92.3% of all “eligible” SUD linkage cases, 12/13).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Deacon has conducted a total of 133 assessments, which means that 81.1% of Deacon’s encounters consisted of an assessment (133/173).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Deacon during this reporting period is 133, with 131 assessments having been screened for a SUD (98.5%, 131/133). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 13 that were positive for SUD (9.9%, 13/131).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    10/2025 \n    16 \n    14 \n    87.5% \n    1 \n    7.1% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    22 \n    22 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    4.5% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    39 \n    39 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    2.6% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    32 \n    32 \n    100.0% \n    8 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    24 \n    24 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    8.3% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    133 \n    131 \n    98.5% \n    13 \n    9.9% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 118 (88.7%, 118/133). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 118 (88.7%, 118/13). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 13), not all assessments (n = 133), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/118).

The total number of assessments Deacon conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 123 assessments (92.5% of all those assessed, 123/133). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 23 assessments (18.7% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 23/123). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 0 assessments (0.0% of all those eligible for PrEP, 0/23).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    10/2025 \n    16 \n    10 \n    62.5% \n    1 \n    10.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    22 \n    22 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    22.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    39 \n    37 \n    94.9% \n    8 \n    21.6% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    32 \n    31 \n    96.9% \n    6 \n    19.4% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    24 \n    23 \n    95.8% \n    3 \n    13.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    133 \n    123 \n    92.5% \n    23 \n    18.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Deacon, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Deacon has conducted (n = 66), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/66). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/66) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.0% of all EHE tests, 0/0).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Deacon has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Deacon’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/66), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/66) and 0.0% for EHE (0/0).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    66 \n    66 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Deacon has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/66), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Deacon currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/66). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Deacon is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least.

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Deacon does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Deacon, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Deacon has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Deacon’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Deacon currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Deacon has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Kathy has conducted a total of 28 assessments, which means that 77.8% of Kathy’s encounters consisted of an assessment (28/772).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Kathy during this reporting period is 28, with 25 assessments having been screened for a SUD (89.3%, 25/28).

If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 17 (60.7%, 17/28). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 17 (60.7%, 17/12). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 12), not all assessments (n = 28), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/17).

Prophylaxis (PrEP)\nPrEP eligibility is covered by several different questions scattered within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Kathy conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 16 assessments (57.1% of all those assessed, 16/28). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 77 assessments (481.2% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 77/16). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 4 assessments (5.2% of all those eligible for PrEP, 4/77).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    700.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    5 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    4 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    3 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    6 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    4 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    9 \n    300.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    2 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    10 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    7 \n    5 \n    71.4% \n    10 \n    200.0% \n    3 \n    30.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    300.0% \n    1 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    250.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    4 \n    3 \n    75.0% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    28 \n    16 \n    57.1% \n    77 \n    481.2% \n    4 \n    5.2% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

    "text": "HIV Testing\nThe total number of HIV tests, including both CTR and EHE tests, are shown in the plot below. These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Kathy, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Kathy has conducted (n = 24), there have been 1 positive tests (4.17% of all HIV tests, 1/24). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/19) and a total of 1 positive EHE tests (20.00% of all EHE tests, 1/5).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Kathy has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/1). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.00% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/1). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Kathy’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/24), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/19) and 0.00% for EHE (0/5).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    24 \n    19 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Kathy has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/24), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Kathy currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/24). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Kathy is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Kathy does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Kathy, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Kathy has been involved with is 362 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Kathy’s cases that were “eligible” were 261 eligible LTC cases (72.1% of all LTC cases, 261/362). Kathy currently has an open case load of 12 open cases (4.6% of all eligible LTC cases, 12/261), with 1 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (8.3% of all open LTC cases, 1/12). Therefore, Kathy has successfully closed 250 LTC cases (95.8% of all eligible LTC cases, 250/261), with a total of 115 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (46.0% of all closed LTC cases, 115/250). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    362 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    261 \n    72.1% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    12 \n    4.6% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    1 \n    8.3% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    250 \n    95.8% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    115 \n    46.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Kathy’s HIV linkage cases.\nKathy has worked on a total of 14 HIV linkage cases (3.9% of all linkage cases, 14/362). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 0 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 0/14), and a total of 14 for those that have been previously diagnosed (100.0% of all HIV linkage cases, 14/14).\nA total of 6 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (42.9% of all HIV linkage cases, 6/14), and the reasons the remaining 8 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 0 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/6), and 6 were for those previously diagnosed (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 6/6). Kathy is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 6 thus far (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 6/6). Out of those cases closed, a total of 6 were unable to be linked to care (100.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 6/6), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Kathy has successfully linked a total of 0 HIV linkage cases (0.0% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 0/6). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 0 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 0/0), and 0 were for those that were previously diagnosed (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 0/6).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Kathy’s HCV linkage cases.\nKathy has worked on a total of 39 HCV linkage cases (10.8% of all linkage cases, 39/362). Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 8 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (20.5% of all HCV linkage cases, 8/39), and a total of 30 for those that have been previously diagnosed (76.9% of all HCV linkage cases, 30/39).\nA total of 31 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (79.5% of all HCV linkage cases, 31/39), and the reasons the remaining 8 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 4 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (12.9% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 4/31), and 26 were for those previously diagnosed (83.9% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 26/31). Kathy is currently working on 0 of these HCV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 31 thus far (100.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 31/31). Out of those cases closed, a total of 24 were unable to be linked to care (77.4% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 24/31), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Kathy has successfully linked a total of 7 HCV linkage cases (22.6% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 7/31). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 1 were for those newly diagnosed with HCV (25.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 1/4), and 6 were for those that were previously diagnosed (23.1% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 6/26).\n\n\nThe SUD Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Kathy’s SUD linkage cases.\nKathy has worked on a total of 336 SUD linkage cases (92.8% of all linkage cases, 336/362).\nA total of 230 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (68.5% of all SUD linkage cases, 230/336), and the reasons the remaining 106 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nKathy is currently working on 6 of these SUD linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 224 thus far (97.4% of all “eligible” SUD linkage cases, 224/230). Out of those cases closed, a total of 120 were unable to be linked to care (53.6% of all closed SUD linkage cases, 120/224), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Kathy has successfully linked a total of 104 SUD linkage cases (46.4% of all closed SUD linkage cases, 104/224).\n\n\nThe Human Trafficking (HT) Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Kathy’s HT linkage cases.\nKathy has worked on a total of 2 HT linkage cases (0.6% of all linkage cases, 2/362).\nA total of 2 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (100.0% of all HT linkage cases, 2/2), and the reasons the remaining 0 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nKathy is currently working on 0 of these HT linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 2 thus far (100.0% of all “eligible” HT linkage cases, 2/2).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Nico has conducted a total of 496 assessments, which means that 93.9% of Nico’s encounters consisted of an assessment (496/536).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Nico during this reporting period is 496, with 480 assessments having been screened for a SUD (96.8%, 480/496). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 14 that were positive for SUD (2.9%, 14/480).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    04/2025 \n    11 \n    11 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    53 \n    49 \n    92.5% \n    1 \n    2.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    58 \n    53 \n    91.4% \n    1 \n    1.9% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    79 \n    77 \n    97.5% \n    2 \n    2.6% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    59 \n    58 \n    98.3% \n    4 \n    6.9% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    53 \n    50 \n    94.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    58 \n    57 \n    98.3% \n    1 \n    1.8% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    41 \n    41 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    2.4% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    26 \n    26 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    30 \n    30 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    10.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    28 \n    28 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    3.6% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    496 \n    480 \n    96.8% \n    14 \n    2.9% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 390 (78.6%, 390/496). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 390 (78.6%, 390/14). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 14), not all assessments (n = 496), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/390).

The total number of assessments Nico conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 461 assessments (92.9% of all those assessed, 461/496). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 37 assessments (8.0% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 37/461). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 2 assessments (5.4% of all those eligible for PrEP, 2/37).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    04/2025 \n    11 \n    7 \n    63.6% \n    1 \n    14.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    53 \n    43 \n    81.1% \n    2 \n    4.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    58 \n    51 \n    87.9% \n    2 \n    3.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    79 \n    75 \n    94.9% \n    7 \n    9.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    59 \n    55 \n    93.2% \n    6 \n    10.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    53 \n    50 \n    94.3% \n    6 \n    12.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    58 \n    57 \n    98.3% \n    6 \n    10.5% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    41 \n    41 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    4.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    26 \n    26 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    3.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    30 \n    29 \n    96.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    28 \n    27 \n    96.4% \n    4 \n    14.8% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    496 \n    461 \n    92.9% \n    37 \n    8.0% \n    2 \n    5.4% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Nico, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Nico has conducted (n = 265), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/265). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/263) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/2).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Nico has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Nico’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/265), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/263) and 0.00% for EHE (0/2).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    265 \n    263 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Nico has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/265), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Nico currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/265). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up. Even if referrals are provided during the linkage process, they are represented here as any information gathered during the encounter could have led to that referral being provided.

Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.\nThere are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list. Those referral types are indicated within the table to the left as well as the figure below, and listed here: primary care (PCP), ED social work (SW), and Peer services.\nThe table to the left highlights the total number of referrals provided during the initial encounter as well as the total number of referrals provided during the linkage follow-up. These referrals do not necessarily mean that Nico is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Nico does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Nico, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Nico has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Nico’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Nico currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Nico has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    0 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously.

Nico is currently working on 0 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 0 thus far (0.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 0/0).

The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Rachel has conducted a total of 30 assessments, which means that 93.8% of Rachel’s encounters consisted of an assessment (30/951).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Rachel during this reporting period is 30, with 27 assessments having been screened for a SUD (90.0%, 27/30). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 0 that were positive for SUD (0.0%, 0/27).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    6 \n    5 \n    83.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    30 \n    27 \n    90.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 1 (3.3%, 1/30). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 1 (3.3%, 1/0). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 0), not all assessments (n = 30), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/1). In regards to the specific conditions that were assessed, those are provided below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    Brief MH Assessed \n    % Brief MH Assessed \n    SUD +

within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Rachel conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 27 assessments (90.0% of all those assessed, 27/30). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 33 assessments (122.2% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 33/27). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 13 assessments (39.4% of all those eligible for PrEP, 13/33).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    01/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    200.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2024 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    200.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    4 \n    4 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    50.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    6 \n    5 \n    83.3% \n    2 \n    40.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    1 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    2 \n    Inf \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    150.0% \n    2 \n    66.7% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    200.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    1 \n    1 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    200.0% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    30 \n    27 \n    90.0% \n    33 \n    122.2% \n    13 \n    39.4% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Rachel, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Rachel has conducted (n = 33), there have been 0 positive tests (0.00% of all HIV tests, 0/33). There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/12) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/21).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Rachel has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Rachel’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/33), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/12) and 0.00% for EHE (0/21).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    33 \n    12 \n    21 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Rachel has had a total of 3 tests that have resulted in a false positive (9.1% of all HIV tests, 3/33), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Rachel currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/33). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up.

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Rachel is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Rachel does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Rachel, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Rachel has been involved with is 825 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Rachel’s cases that were “eligible” were 615 eligible LTC cases (74.5% of all LTC cases, 615/825). Rachel currently has an open case load of 8 open cases (1.3% of all eligible LTC cases, 8/615), with 1 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (12.5% of all open LTC cases, 1/8). Therefore, Rachel has successfully closed 608 LTC cases (98.9% of all eligible LTC cases, 608/615), with a total of 136 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (22.4% of all closed LTC cases, 136/608). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    825 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    615 \n    74.5% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    8 \n    1.3% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    1 \n    12.5% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    608 \n    98.9% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    136 \n    22.4% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Rachel’s HIV linkage cases.\nRachel has worked on a total of 192 HIV linkage cases (23.3% of all linkage cases, 192/825). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 13 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (6.8% of all HIV linkage cases, 13/192), and a total of 179 for those that have been previously diagnosed (93.2% of all HIV linkage cases, 179/192).\nA total of 80 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (41.7% of all HIV linkage cases, 80/192), and the reasons the remaining 112 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 11 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (13.8% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 11/80), and 69 were for those previously diagnosed (86.2% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 69/80). Rachel is currently working on 2 of these HIV linkage cases (50.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 78 thus far (97.5% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 78/80). Out of those cases closed, a total of 51 were unable to be linked to care (65.4% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 51/78), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Rachel has successfully linked a total of 27 HIV linkage cases (34.6% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 27/78). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 10 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (90.9% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 10/11), and 17 were for those that were previously diagnosed (24.6% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 17/69).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Rachel’s HCV linkage cases.\nRachel has worked on a total of 651 HCV linkage cases (78.9% of all linkage cases, 651/825). Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 248 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (38.1% of all HCV linkage cases, 248/651), and a total of 397 for those that have been previously diagnosed (61.0% of all HCV linkage cases, 397/651).\nA total of 537 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (82.5% of all HCV linkage cases, 537/651), and the reasons the remaining 114 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 212 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (39.5% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 212/537), and 319 were for those previously diagnosed (59.4% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 319/537). Rachel is currently working on 6 of these HCV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 531 thus far (98.9% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 531/537). Out of those cases closed, a total of 430 were unable to be linked to care (81.0% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 430/531), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Rachel has successfully linked a total of 101 HCV linkage cases (19.0% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 101/531). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 36 were for those newly diagnosed with HCV (17.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 36/212), and 65 were for those that were previously diagnosed (20.4% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 65/319).\n\n\nThe SUD Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Rachel’s SUD linkage cases.\nRachel has worked on a total of 32 SUD linkage cases (3.9% of all linkage cases, 32/825).\nA total of 22 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (68.8% of all SUD linkage cases, 22/32), and the reasons the remaining 10 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nRachel is currently working on 0 of these SUD linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 22 thus far (100.0% of all “eligible” SUD linkage cases, 22/22).

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Skylar has conducted a total of 206 assessments, which means that 83.1% of Skylar’s encounters consisted of an assessment (206/257).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Skylar during this reporting period is 206, with 199 assessments having been screened for a SUD (96.6%, 199/206). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 31 that were positive for SUD (15.6%, 31/199).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    08/2025 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    32 \n    31 \n    96.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    37 \n    35 \n    94.6% \n    2 \n    5.7% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    32 \n    31 \n    96.9% \n    5 \n    16.1% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    35 \n    35 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    44 \n    41 \n    93.2% \n    12 \n    29.3% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    29.4% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    206 \n    199 \n    96.6% \n    31 \n    15.6% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 173 (84.0%, 173/206). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 173 (84.0%, 173/31). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 31), not all assessments (n = 206), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/173).

The total number of assessments Skylar conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 196 assessments (95.1% of all those assessed, 196/206). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 40 assessments (20.4% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 40/196). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 6 assessments (15.0% of all those eligible for PrEP, 6/40).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    08/2025 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    22.2% \n    1 \n    50.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    32 \n    27 \n    84.4% \n    4 \n    14.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    37 \n    37 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    16.2% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    32 \n    32 \n    100.0% \n    7 \n    21.9% \n    1 \n    14.3% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    35 \n    34 \n    97.1% \n    11 \n    32.4% \n    1 \n    9.1% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    44 \n    40 \n    90.9% \n    7 \n    17.5% \n    2 \n    28.6% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    17 \n    17 \n    100.0% \n    3 \n    17.6% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    206 \n    196 \n    95.1% \n    40 \n    20.4% \n    6 \n    15.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

There have been a total of 0 positive CTR tests (0.00% of all CTR tests, 0/108) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.0% of all EHE tests, 0/0).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Skylar has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/0). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.0% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/0) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Skylar’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/108), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/108) and 0.0% for EHE (0/0).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    108 \n    108 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Skylar has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/108), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Skylar currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/108). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

These referrals do not necessarily mean that Skylar is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least.

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Skylar does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Skylar, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Skylar has been involved with is 0 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Skylar’s cases that were “eligible” were 0 eligible LTC cases (0.0% of all LTC cases, 0/0). Skylar currently has an open case load of 0 open cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with 0 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (0.0% of all open LTC cases, 0/0). Therefore, Skylar has successfully closed 0 LTC cases (0.0% of all eligible LTC cases, 0/0), with a total of 0 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (0.0% of all closed LTC cases, 0/0). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below.

    "text": "Assessments\nAssessment data contains a lot of important information regarding patient risk and needs, and help determine whether or not the appropriate information and referrals are being provided during the encounter. The assessment data is analyzed in this section and broken down by specific questions to determine when certain screening tools are utilized to determine patient needs. The assessment contains data regarding substance use disorder (SUD), mental health (MH), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), all examined below. Timothy has conducted a total of 455 assessments, which means that 73.3% of Timothy’s encounters consisted of an assessment (455/1029).\nA summary of the general monthly trends of screening for each of these conditions is shown in the plot below. The description of the screening tools, as well as the number of screens and positivity per month are discussed within this section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance Use Disorder (SUD)\nSUD disorder measures include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse as well as the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), or the NM-ASSIST for all forms of substance abuse disorder. If any of the questions within this scale are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for SUD. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on either the AUDIT-C or the NM-ASSIST, then they are considered positive for a SUD. The total number of assessments completed by Timothy during this reporting period is 455, with 416 assessments having been screened for a SUD (91.4%, 416/455). For all assessments where the individual was screened for a SUD, there were a total of 17 that were positive for SUD (4.1%, 17/416).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessments \n    SUD Assessed \n    % SUD Assessed \n    SUD + \n    % SUD + \n  \n \n\n  \n    02/2024 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    22.2% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    22 \n    20 \n    90.9% \n    3 \n    15.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    15 \n    14 \n    93.3% \n    1 \n    7.1% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    32 \n    29 \n    90.6% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    29 \n    26 \n    89.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    32 \n    32 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    30 \n    29 \n    96.7% \n    1 \n    3.4% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    32 \n    32 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    20 \n    18 \n    90.0% \n    1 \n    5.6% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    6 \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    17 \n    16 \n    94.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    21 \n    21 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    28 \n    26 \n    92.9% \n    1 \n    3.8% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    27 \n    25 \n    92.6% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    25 \n    23 \n    92.0% \n    2 \n    8.7% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    16 \n    16 \n    100.0% \n    1 \n    6.2% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    27 \n    22 \n    81.5% \n    2 \n    9.1% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    16 \n    13 \n    81.2% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    15 \n    14 \n    93.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    20 \n    15 \n    75.0% \n    2 \n    13.3% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    7 \n    3 \n    42.9% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    3 \n    3 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    455 \n    416 \n    91.4% \n    17 \n    4.1% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health (MH)\nMH measures within the EIP assessment include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList (PCL) for Civilians (PCL-C) for PTSD. If any of the questions within these scales are answered by the patient during the encounter, then they are considered screened for MH. There are scores associated with these measures, and those are calculated within the EIP Database in the background as data is entered. If the individual meets criteria on any of these scales for these MH conditions, then they are considered positive for a MH condition. However, it is important to note: prior to January 2024, we only conducted the full MH measures for those that were also positive for a SUD, not all those assessed. Prior to 2024, we conducted shortened versions of the PHQ (PHQ2) and the GAD (GAD2) for all those assessed, but we had only asked the full versions and the PCL-C scale when they were determined positive for any SUD. The total number of assessments where at least one of the questions were asked on these condensed scales was 372 (81.8%, 372/455). The total number of assessments where the patient screened positive for a SUD and completed at least one of the questions on these MH measures was 372 (81.8%, 372/17). Remember, the denominator used here is the number of assessments where the individual was SUD positive (n = 17), not all assessments (n = 455), since the full MH assessments were only available to those who had a SUD prior to 2024.\nFor all assessments where the individual was positive for a SUD and screened for MH, there were a total of 0 that were positive for at least one of the MH conditions screened for on the EIP assessment (0.0%, 0/372).

(PrEP)\nPrEP eligibility is covered by several different questions scattered within the assessment that determine whether an individual may be at risk for contracting HIV and could benefit from a PrEP assessment. The total number of assessments Timothy conducted where the individual answered at least one of the questions regarding their risk of contracting HIV, and therefore their potential need for PrEP, was 370 assessments (81.3% of all those assessed, 370/455). The total number of assessments where the individual was considered at risk and therefore eligible for PrEP was 111 assessments (30.0% of all those assessed for their HIV risk, 111/370). Once an individual is determined to be eligible for PrEP based on their risks for contracting HIV, our staff is then instructed to discuss the individual’s knowledge of PrEP and several other factors, providing education and a referral for PrEP initiation and linkage to a provider. The PrEP assessment is defined as being conducted as long as at least one of the questions within this individualized assessment is answered. The total number of assessments where the individual was eligible for PrEP based on their risks and received this PrEP assessment was 16 assessments (14.4% of all those eligible for PrEP, 16/111).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Assessed \n    Risk Assessed \n    % At Risk \n    PrEP Eligible \n    % Eligible \n    PrEP Assessed \n    % Assessed \n  \n \n\n  \n    02/2024 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    03/2024 \n    9 \n    9 \n    100.0% \n    5 \n    55.6% \n    4 \n    80.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2024 \n    22 \n    20 \n    90.9% \n    5 \n    25.0% \n    3 \n    60.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2024 \n    15 \n    12 \n    80.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2024 \n    32 \n    29 \n    90.6% \n    8 \n    27.6% \n    1 \n    12.5% \n  \n  \n    07/2024 \n    29 \n    23 \n    79.3% \n    2 \n    8.7% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2024 \n    32 \n    29 \n    90.6% \n    5 \n    17.2% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2024 \n    30 \n    25 \n    83.3% \n    3 \n    12.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    10/2024 \n    32 \n    27 \n    84.4% \n    4 \n    14.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    11/2024 \n    20 \n    16 \n    80.0% \n    4 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    12/2024 \n    6 \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2025 \n    17 \n    16 \n    94.1% \n    4 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2025 \n    21 \n    18 \n    85.7% \n    7 \n    38.9% \n    1 \n    14.3% \n  \n  \n    03/2025 \n    28 \n    25 \n    89.3% \n    10 \n    40.0% \n    1 \n    10.0% \n  \n  \n    04/2025 \n    27 \n    19 \n    70.4% \n    7 \n    36.8% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    05/2025 \n    25 \n    19 \n    76.0% \n    4 \n    21.1% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    06/2025 \n    16 \n    12 \n    75.0% \n    3 \n    25.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    07/2025 \n    27 \n    14 \n    51.9% \n    2 \n    14.3% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    08/2025 \n    16 \n    12 \n    75.0% \n    6 \n    50.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    09/2025 \n    15 \n    14 \n    93.3% \n    7 \n    50.0% \n    3 \n    42.9% \n  \n  \n    10/2025 \n    20 \n    13 \n    65.0% \n    6 \n    46.2% \n    1 \n    16.7% \n  \n  \n    11/2025 \n    7 \n    6 \n    85.7% \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    2 \n    33.3% \n  \n  \n    12/2025 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    01/2026 \n    2 \n    2 \n    100.0% \n    6 \n    300.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    02/2026 \n    3 \n    2 \n    66.7% \n    3 \n    150.0% \n    0 \n    0.0% \n  \n  \n    Totals \n    455 \n    370 \n    81.3% \n    111 \n    30.0% \n    16 \n    14.4% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual is considered at risk for contracting HIV and eligible for PrEP based on whether they meet at least one of the criteria listed below.

These only include rapid-based HIV tests that are performed by Timothy, and does not include any lab tests that are initiated by medical staff prompted by EIP, or lab draws performed in the community (unless it is the result of an initial rapid test). The plot has the ability to select only CTR/EHE tests, and has the ability to zoom in on particular time frames by clicking and dragging. You can reset the graph by double-clicking within the plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the total number of HIV tests that Timothy has conducted (n = 229), there have been 1 positive tests (0.44% of all HIV tests, 1/229). There have been a total of 1 positive CTR tests (0.49% of all CTR tests, 1/206) and a total of 0 positive EHE tests (0.00% of all EHE tests, 0/23).\nFor the individuals positively identified through testing, Timothy has identified a total of 0 new positive individuals (0.0% of all positive HIV tests, 0/1). This number is comprised of 0 new positives from CTR testing (0.00% percent of all CTR positive tests, 0/1) and 0 new positives from EHE testing (0.0% percent of all EHE positive tests, 0/0). Therefore, the overall positivity rate for Timothy’s HIV testing is 0.00% (0/229), and for each program specifically is as follows: 0.00% for CTR (0/206) and 0.00% for EHE (0/23).\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    CTR \n    EHE \n  \n \n\n  \n    Number of Tests \n    229 \n    206 \n    23 \n  \n  \n    Positives \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    New Positives \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Positivity Rate \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n    0.00% \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nAdditionally, false positive tests occur when the individual has an initial reactive/positive test, but additional testing shows that their final status is actually a negative result. Timothy has had a total of 0 tests that have resulted in a false positive (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/229), or those that had an initial reactive result but a final negative status.\nThere are also instances when the initial test may be reactive, but the confirmatory test is negative, leading to a discordant result that requires additional testing (HIV RNA testing). Until that RNA testing is completed, this is known as an Indeterminate result. Timothy currently has a total of 0 tests that are indeterminate and in need of RNA testing (0.0% of all HIV tests, 0/229). This is counted when the final test status is noted as Indeterminate. When the RNA testing confirms the final result, the final status is updated. Therefore, this only counts those that are currently marked as Indeterminate and have not had the follow-up RNA testing necessary to know the individual’s final HIV status."

Referrals are also documented in multiple places within the EIP database, those provided during the encounter and those provided during any linkage follow-up. Even if referrals are provided during the linkage process, they are represented here as any information gathered during the encounter could have led to that referral being provided.

Regardless of the nature of the referral, they way a referral is defined here is as long as one of those options are covered for that service.\nThere are a few referrals that are only documented at the encounter level, and do not have any component for documentation on the linkage referral list. Those referral types are indicated within the table to the left as well as the figure below, and listed here: primary care (PCP), ED social work (SW), and Peer services.\nThe table to the left highlights the total number of referrals provided during the initial encounter as well as the total number of referrals provided during the linkage follow-up. These referrals do not necessarily mean that Timothy is the one who made the referral, since referrals can be made at any point during the encounter/linkage process and by anyone involved. For example, one staff member may be responsible for one portion of the encounter/linkage, and provided referrals, whereas another staff member may be responsible for another part of the encounter/linkage and provided the referral.\nThe figure below shows the total number of referrals that were provided by each service. This includes any referrals provided during either the initial encounter or the linkage follow-up. The figure is sorted by most total referrals provided to the least. A service referral is only counted once here as long as it was made during either the encounter or linkage process. For example, if an HIV referral was made bother during the encounter and linkage process, it is only counted once for that encounter."

    "text": "Linkage to Care\nLinkage to care (LTC) cases can be initiated for any number of reasons, including (but not limited to) self-report of need from the individual, identification of need based on EIP assessment and/or testing information, referral from medical staff outside of EIP, community referrals, or identification and/or referrals based on screening and testing through typical ED/hospital care. Some of our linkage staff are more specialized in specific types of LTC services, while some are cross-trained and can work multiple LTC services. Therefore, this section will cover all aspects of EIP LTC services, so if Timothy does not cover some aspects of linkage, that area will still be represented here but will not show any data, or limited data based on the overall encounter and linkage information maintained within the record. This section will first go over the summary of cases worked by Timothy, and general numbers of each linkage service and outcome, then will go into greater examination of each type of LTC service.\nThe total number of LTC cases that Timothy has been involved with is 311 LTC cases. Our linkage staff is trained to open a linkage case any time need is identified, and then we are able to know the outcome of the case based on their documention within that LTC case. This way, we are able to understand the full scope of need for those we encounter, and determine what happens as we try to engage the patient after their ED visit. We use the term “eligible” cases for those that our linkage team are realistically able to follow-up with and at least have some ability to engage with the individual after leaving the ED. Cases that are designated as “ineligible” include the following situations: the patient is already linked to care, they are deceased, they are incarcerated, they decline linkage services, or there is no contact information for which to follow-up. Also, ongoing linkage cases mean that the individual already has a current linkage case open, so rather than working multiple cases or counting the linkage case twice, we exclude these situations due to ongoing linkage already in process. The total number of Timothy’s cases that were “eligible” were 241 eligible LTC cases (77.5% of all LTC cases, 241/311). Timothy currently has an open case load of 32 open cases (13.3% of all eligible LTC cases, 32/241), with 2 open LTC cases being open longer than 90 days (6.2% of all open LTC cases, 2/32). Therefore, Timothy has successfully closed 210 LTC cases (87.1% of all eligible LTC cases, 210/241), with a total of 54 cases successfully linked to care for their particular service (25.7% of all closed LTC cases, 54/210). A summary table of these total LTC numbers are shown below. For each particular type of LTC service, you can review each tab below the table.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    Total \n    % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Cases \n    311 \n     \n  \n  \n    Eligible Cases \n    241 \n    77.5% \n  \n  \n    Open Cases \n    32 \n    13.3% \n  \n  \n    Open &gt;90 days \n    2 \n    6.2% \n  \n  \n    Closed Cases \n    210 \n    87.1% \n  \n  \n    Linked \n    54 \n    25.7% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIVHCVSUDHuman TraffickingMental HealthHousingPrEPAdditional services\n\n\nHIV linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HIV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Timothy’s HIV linkage cases.\nTimothy has worked on a total of 64 HIV linkage cases (20.6% of all linkage cases, 64/311). Out of all HIV linkage cases, there were a total of 1 for those newly diagnosed with HIV (1.6% of all HIV linkage cases, 1/64), and a total of 63 for those that have been previously diagnosed (98.4% of all HIV linkage cases, 63/64).\nA total of 26 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (40.6% of all HIV linkage cases, 26/64), and the reasons the remaining 38 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 1 were for those newly diagnosed for HIV (3.8% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 1/26), and 25 were for those previously diagnosed (96.2% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 25/26). Timothy is currently working on 13 of these HIV linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 13 thus far (50.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases, 13/26). Out of those cases closed, a total of 8 were unable to be linked to care (61.5% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 8/13), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Timothy has successfully linked a total of 5 HIV linkage cases (38.5% of all closed HIV linkage cases, 5/13). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 1 were for those newly diagnosed with HIV (100.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 1/1), and 4 were for those that were previously diagnosed (16.0% of all “eligible” HIV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 4/25).\n\n\nHepatitis C linkage cases are further stratified by those that are cases worked for individuals newly diagnosed versus those that were diagnosed previously. The HCV Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Timothy’s HCV linkage cases.\nTimothy has worked on a total of 254 HCV linkage cases (81.7% of all linkage cases, 254/311). Out of all HCV linkage cases, there were a total of 93 for those newly diagnosed with HCV (36.6% of all HCV linkage cases, 93/254), and a total of 160 for those that have been previously diagnosed (63.0% of all HCV linkage cases, 160/254).\nA total of 213 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (83.9% of all HCV linkage cases, 213/254), and the reasons the remaining 41 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nOut of those “eligible” to be linked, 83 were for those newly diagnosed for HCV (39.0% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 83/213), and 129 were for those previously diagnosed (60.6% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 129/213). Timothy is currently working on 18 of these HCV linkage cases (11.1% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 195 thus far (91.5% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases, 195/213). Out of those cases closed, a total of 150 were unable to be linked to care (76.9% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 150/195), with the reasons as to why are shown in the flow diagram. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, and there could be multiple reasons why those linkage cases were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Timothy has successfully linked a total of 45 HCV linkage cases (23.1% of all closed HCV linkage cases, 45/195). Out of all those cases that were successfully linked to care, 17 were for those newly diagnosed with HCV (20.5% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for newly diagnosed individuals, 17/83), and 28 were for those that were previously diagnosed (21.7% of all “eligible” HCV linkage cases for previously diagnosed individuals, 28/129).\n\n\nThe SUD Linkage Flow Diagram is provided here for Timothy’s SUD linkage cases.\nTimothy has worked on a total of 14 SUD linkage cases (4.5% of all linkage cases, 14/311).\nA total of 10 of these cases are “eligible” to be linked to care (71.4% of all SUD linkage cases, 10/14), and the reasons the remaining 4 were “ineligible” are noted in the flow diagram.\nTimothy is currently working on 2 of these SUD linkage cases (0.0% of which have been open for more than 90 days), and therefore has closed a total of 8 thus far (80.0% of all “eligible” SUD linkage cases, 8/10).
